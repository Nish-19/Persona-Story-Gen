        "comment": "\u201cSo,\u201d Quinlan slides onto the bench next to Obi-Wan, knocking his tray against Obi-Wan\u2019s already cluttered offerings. \u201cYour Commander is trying out a new lip colour then?\u201d\nObi-Wan straightens, something close to fear twisting through the pit of his stomach. His spine feels drawn too tight, a puppet with ill-fitting strings as he forces himself to glance over at the other man, ensuring that his brow doesn\u2019t rise past the notch of mild disapproval. He pokes at the porridge with his free hand, the pale lilac surface giving way before it reforms over the intrusion. \u201cHe is though I fail to see how that is any of your business.\u201d\n\u201cPurple?\u201d\nObi-Wan considers punching Quinlan. It would be undeniably childish of him and he could already hear the disapproving words of Master Windu echo in the back of his thoughts, some reactions never got easier to weather despite the fact that Obi-Wan hasn\u2019t been a Knight for nearly two decades now and a Padawan for even longer. But Quinlan\u2019s grin is just the right shade of sharp, honed and cultivated to imply the exact amount of knowing something that his target doesn\u2019t that would make someone hesitate to punch him. Even if he more than deserves it. \u201cNow, why should that matter?\u201d\nQuinlan leans forward, propping his chin onto Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder. His dreadlocks swing free, and Obi-Wan catches them, abandoning his absent-minded prodding of his food to do so. There\u2019s a faint scent of lavender that comes with the motion, a poor attempt at hiding the tang of engine oil and industrial work. He pulls the locks away as he turns to look down at Quinlan, the pair of them now nearly nose-to-nose.\nHis eyes dark and his grin only widening, drawing and redrawing the line in the sand that he is determined to toe, Quinlan asks, \u201cSo, I am right?\u201d\nObi-Wan licks Quinlan\u2019s nose, still childish but less overtly so. Quinlan recalls, tugging against Obi-Wan\u2019s hold on his locks, and swipes at his shoulder with a laugh. He looks younger when he\u2019s laughing, the harsh lines of grief and suffering the war had drawn over his countenance. Scrubbing at his face with the heel of his palm, Quinlan rocks forward, tapping his knuckles against Obi-Wan\u2019s tray. \u201cDon\u2019t need you to answer, Obi. I know I\u2019m right just by this.\u201d\nHis breakfast tray. It is full but Obi-Wan is intending on carrying the rest back to his rooms, their rooms now that Cody has moved in with the war resolving in a mostly settled ceasefire. Obi-Wan\u2019s gaze skips over the small bowl of porridge, the normal cream shade tinted lilac by the addition of some fruit, then to the plate of potato. It is a new variant from a planet that has only recently opened up the trade routes and the flesh is a dark purple. He has a salad for some variety, dark leaves and curls of a paler purple carrot scattered amongst it and\u2014 Oh.\nOh\n.\n\u201cHow long have I been doing this?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Quinlan reaches over and selects a piece of fruit from Obi-Wan\u2019s tray, purple like all the rest of it. \u201cMatching your meal and nearly every other choice on that day to the colour of your Commander\u2019s lipstick?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Quin. That.\u201d\n\u201cPractically since he started wearing it.\u201d\nObi-Wan bites back a curse and stands, drawing his tray close to his chest. He\u2019d thought that he was being careful with his crush on the other man, keeping it close to his chest and obfuscated behind several very plausible reasons for his level of attention, of care. Had Cody noticed? Obi-Wan\u2019s crush, as it was, is his own problem to cope with. He doesn\u2019t want to inflict it upon Cody if it isn\u2019t returned. \u201cThank you for your insights, Quin.\u201d\nQuinlan waves him away, the self-shame grin plastered over his face once more, and Obi-Wan takes his leave, his tray clasped in front of him. Cody is sprawled across the sofa as Obi-Wan enteres, much the same position he had been earlier that morning, with the addition of a holopad clutched in one hand. He pauses the video as Obi-Wan enters sitting up with a grin. \u201cShort queue?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Obi-Wan joins him, sliding the tray onto the table. Purple food, purple lipstick carefully painted over Cody\u2019s mouth. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d\nCody blinks, smiling gently up at him. \u201cThought you were never going to ask.\u201d\nHe leans forward and Obi-Wan learns that his lipstick tastes as sweet as it looks."

        "comment": "\u201c\u2014and if we refer back to Rees\u2019 earlier work on the subject, we can see that several of the points he makes contradict Butler\u2019s publication. That publication had, until that point, been viewed as the de facto resource.\u201d\nCody nods along with Obi-Wan\u2019s words, letting them wash over him. The other man\u2019s shoes squeak as he paces up and down the small aisle, the edges of his heels catching on the rough edge of the runners. They\u2019re slightly oversized, bought to grow into even as Obi-Wan approaches his third decade of life and hasn\u2019t grown an inch since he hit eighteen, and polished to a sheen. Cody glances over as Obi-Wan passes by him once more, confirming his suspicions in the slight gap between his pressed trouser leg and his shoes. His socks are a repeating pattern of anchors picked out in white on a darker blue background. They are also Cody\u2019s.\nHe adds another line to his notes, drawing a sharp curve down to another section. Tapping the pen against the paper, Cody chews on his lower lip, and adds another piece.\n\u201cHow do you think that was, Cody?\u201d\nCody blinks up at Obi-Wan, who has stopped pacing at the row behind him and leans over towards Cody. He has braced his hands against the edge of the desk, his fingers brushing against Cody\u2019s curls as he tips his head back. Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes are bright, entirely focused on Cody, but his lip is chewed rough and Cody knows, if he could see them, the edges of his nails would be in a similar state.\n\u201cIt went well. You kept a good pace and it fits with your slides.\u201d Cody pauses, twirling his pen around his fingers. He fumbles it for an instant as Obi-Wan leans closer, his breath warm against Cody\u2019s forehead and faintly floral, matching the scent wafting from the thermos Obi-Wan had placed on the edge of the desk. \u201cObi-Wan. You can do this.\u201d\nObi-Wan blinks, tipping further forward with a sigh. He presses his forehead to Cody\u2019s, closing his eyes. \u201cI know,\u201d he murmurs. They stay like that for a moment before Cody reaches behind himself, brushing his fingers over Obi-Wan\u2019s hair before scratching roughly at one spot like he would for a pet. Obi-Wan recoils with a huff, before he leans forwards once more, stretching past Cody to pick up his thermos.\nHe takes a long sip from it, breathing out through his nose. He coughs and passes the thermos to Cody who accepts it gratefully. He doesn\u2019t drink from it straightaway, twisting the thermos round and round in his hands. It\u2019s warm, the heat from the tea beginning to bleed through the plastic and Cody thinks about the press of Obi-Wan\u2019s hands against it. It\u2019s an idle thought curling across his mind, but it snags every single weave on its way past leaving him snarled and tangled. He is going to have to do something and he knows what that is.\n\u201cObi-Wan?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Obi-Wan raises himself back up onto his hands, hovering over Cody\u2019s face. \u201cIf you\u2019re thirsty, you can have some tea. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nCody bites back a laugh but some of his humour must still show across his face. Obi-Wan grins down at him, huffing through his own laughter. \u201cI know. I know. Quibbling over shared beverages seems like an odd point at this stage.\u201d Obi-Wan catches himself, a pale flush colouring his cheeks. It doesn\u2019t match well with the darker shade of his hair and beard and Cody is infatuated with it all the same. \u201cBut I feel like I need to have some principles.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Cody asks, raising a brow at Obi-Wan who only straightens himself up further, adjusting his grip just behind Cody\u2019s head. His arms shake slightly but Obi-Wan stabilises himself. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through?\u201d\nObi-Wan chuckles, his grin only widening. \u201cYou sound like a bad soap opera.\u201d\nCody joins him in laughing. Their apartment is small with minimal soundproofing so the conflicting sound of the tv from the surrounding apartments filtered through the walls day and night. It may have been a strange form of protest to join in on the cacophony of sound, but Cody had wound up resting his elbows on the back of the sofa, watching whatever strange programme Obi-Wan had settled on that evening. They were strangely compelling after a time.\n\u201cJust for you.\u201d Cody blinks up at Obi-Wan, committing the moment to memory \u2014 the dark shade of his eyes, the blush covering his cheeks, the devoted attention that he\u2019s directing towards Cody completely \u2014 and he pushes himself up to kiss him. It is strange kissing someone upside down, Obi-Wan\u2019s beard scratching at his cheek and chin, before Obi-Wan draws back with a gasp, leaning further forward to kiss Cody once more. Cody steadies the thermos with his other hand, the liquid inside sloshing against the edges before he places it back on the desk without looking. His lingering thirst can wait. He has something more important to focus on."

        "post_title": "Obi-Wan returns home with the prospect of a few days off at the same time as her flat mate, Cody, in front of them both.",
        "comment": "The flat is quiet when Obi-Wan manages to wrangle the door open through a mess of foliage and delicate string lights that throng their hallway. No need to worry about alarms or a security system when they had the normal mess and clutter of everyday life. She steps over Cody\u2019s work boots, placed into the same spot every day, and loosely toes her own shoes off next to them. The sole gapes wide as she does so, revealing the softer innards of fabric straining away from rubber, and she ignores it as best as she can.\nTape is a godsend and where tape wouldn\u2019t fix it, there is a small tube of superglue in one of the drawers she can ask Cody to try. The pads of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingers are still discoloured from her last attempt at trying to fix a pair of her shoes so she\u2019ll pass the problem to more capable hands. Her jacket is summarily discarded onto the back of the sofa and she lingers long enough to retrieve her lanyard and keys from the pocket, returning them to their forced exclusion into the small bowl on the counter for the next two days. The time off from work stretches luxuriously empty, free from any mandatory training or social obligations, and Obi-Wan skirts around the potential issue of their unique living arrangement as she flicks on the kettle, pulling one mug out of the cupboard, pausing and returning for another. Cody has the next couple of days off as well, a rarity with their opposite working schedules. Obi-Wan makes Cody\u2019s cup of coffee how she likes it, strong and sweet and a splash of milk first despite Obi-Wan\u2019s moral objections to the concept, and rifles through her small collection of tea. There is no caffeine in her immediate future if she wants to sleep for any part of the morning; another hidden delight of adulthood that\u2019s tripped her over and bruised up her face. She chews on the tip of her tongue as she draws a bag free, dropping it into her cup and chasing it with the boiling water.\nA door creaks further in the apartment and Obi-Wan rocks back onto her heels, a dozy prickle of contentment resting on the nape of her neck. Cody\u2019s steps are steady, sleep-slow and her slippers smack against the floor as she makes her way into the sitting room. Much of her isn\u2019t visible, a walking plaid blanket that hides her face and her curls, but the tattoo over her calf is clearly visible with one of her pyjama trouser legs drawn up over her knee while the other falls to the floor.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Obi-Wan says, breaking into a yawn that she doesn\u2019t bother to hide behind her hand. Her manners are ingrained into her bones but even that runs thin and fallow after so long spent at work.\n\u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d Cody responds, her words muffled through fabric and sleep. Obi-Wan can picture her expression, her eyes still mostly closed and her gaze filtered through her impossibly long lashes and her grin easily worn in.\nObi-Wan follows her, both mugs in hand, and places them onto the clear spaces on their cluttered coffee table. She has options for seating, the low slouch of a battered armchair Obi-Wan carried to her student dorm, then flat, then four different flatshares before this one or the other end of the sofa that Cody has already claimed, piled high with blankets and a handful of cushions that Cody would claim as family heirlooms at the first hint of decluttering. She sits on Cody\u2019s legs stretched out over the seat before she wriggles backwards into the hollow created. Cody grunts, shifting her legs straighter before she reaches down to tug a section of the blanket free, pulling it over Obi-Wan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in early,\u201d Cody mumbles. She\u2019s partially spilled out of the blanket now wrapped around her waist. She stretches and her shirt rises with the motion, everything about her solid and real and beautiful.\nObi-Wan hums in agreement, leaning sideways against Cody who absorbs the motion with a soft sound. She wraps an arm around Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulders, playing with the loose edge of her sleeve. \u201cMove your head up a bit? You\u2019re lying right on my tit.\u201d Obi-Wan does so, her face flushed but it\u2019s fine. It happens. Cody continues, her voice a little more structured as she wakes, \u201cFigured you\u2019d like the bed to sleep after your night shift so I came out here for the morning. It\u2019ll be nice having us both around the house, little human company to prove I\u2019m not just another cog in the machine.\u201d\nIf Cody is a cog, then she would be the best cog imaginable, something brimming with lots of interlocking teeth, a fundamental piece of the machinery. Obi-Wan tells her this because why wouldn\u2019t she? It makes perfect sense.\nCody tips her head back as she laughs, the sound vibrating through Obi-Wan like it would rattle all the broken pieces in her chest back together. She curls closer, crossing her legs one over the other and then swapping them back, and Cody rights herself carefully, smearing the heel of her palm across her eyes. She curls her hand around Obi-Wan\u2019s head, drawing her face upwards. The air hangs still and heavy, steam curling from their mugs nearly forgotten on the table, and Cody leans down, kissing Obi-Wan. She tastes like coffee and a stale tang of sleep and like home. Obi-Wan grins against her mouth, pressing herself closer, the mugs and sleep entirely forgotten."

        "post_title": "Cody hides in the bridge to get some late-night work done. Obi-Wan joins him.",
        "comment": "Cody tugs his bucket off his head, placing it carefully onto the empty surface next to him, the screens deactivated hours ago but the air just above them hums with static. It crackles against his skin, the bare sliver at his wrist between the heavy fabric of his gloves and the thinner lining of his bodysuit, and he presses his hand down, just letting himself breathe. He exists in the hollow between the base of his skull and the curls that hang heavy with sweat, the hum of the air recycling accompanying a chill washing over him, and he pulls himself away from the table. The stations are empty on the main bridge; a skeleton crew stationed a couple of levels down and Cody is alone here. He turns the empty eyes of his helmet away, directing the face towards the wall as he has already experienced the strange disconnect of seeing a brother\u2019s helmet discarded on a table but somehow, still watching him. One of the chairs squeaks as he draws it back, spinning it from side to side by rocking his palm over the back. Some of the covering flakes off and sticks to his skin and he picks it off as he returns to the table to retrieve the other items he had brought with him.\nHe just couldn\u2019t be in his room any longer.\nHis caf is still warm, a faint curl of steam spilling from the top of the mug as Cody removes the lid, knocking the condensation back into the mug and wiping the remains on his trousers. Peeling off his gloves with his teeth, Cody cups the mug, ignoring the notification flashing on his datapad for the moment. The ping from his helmet is dull, echoing strangely in the vast space, and Cody hears it several seconds late and still ignores it. He just needs a moment, a single solitary moment before reality can break into the fragments between his armour and begin to rot him away once more. He doesn\u2019t need to do this, but he wants to. Obi-Wan had mentioned the pile of reports he had to look into several hours earlier and sleep is still several hours away so Cody has taken the datapad and a handful of supplies to work through them. He can be useful like this when he can not do anything else.\nThe hours slip by slowly, every minute drawn out to the breaking point before it passes. Cody sips at his caf, the liquid cooling into near-enough sludge that Cody scrapes his teeth against as he flips onto the next report. The door slides open behind him and Cody starts, his knee impacting against the underside of the console and his cup falls from the side as he knocks it with his elbow when he turns. The smash he is expecting never happens.\n\u201cHello, love.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s hand is extended, his first two fingers pressed against his thumb and he moves his hand, sweeping it in a delicate circle. Cody\u2019s mug, suspended in midair, taps against the desk, sliding across the surface until it rests a handspan further in than it had previously. \u201cYou\u2019re here late.\u201d\n\u201cI could say the same thing about you.\u201d Cody scrubs his hand against his knee, the pain a dull pulse that is swiftly lessening from the initial bright burst of agony, and looks over at Obi-Wan, grinning up at the other man. \u201cHow did you know it was me from over there?\u201d\nObi-Wan chuckles, tipping his head to one side as he folds his hands together over his stomach. He is dressed in soft layers, a pale robe belted over a darker shirt and trousers, and everything flows as he walks over, curling his arms around Cody. He leans down, pressing his cheek to Cody\u2019s, his beard scratching in a way that prickles and aches and Cody leans into it all the same. It would be so easy to kiss Obi-Wan like this, to turn his face and lean in impossibly closer. They have done so much together, lived a thousand lifetimes in the space between battles when they can be just men instead of a Commander and his General. He loved Obi-Wan before he had the words for it.\n\u201cYou shine in the Force, my dear. I could find you amongst a sea of your brothers, even without your stripes on your armour or your scar. I know you.\u201d\nCody flushes, leaning into Obi-Wan\u2019s touch and tapping the side of his head against Obi-Wan\u2019s temple. The other man hums low in the base of his throat, squeezing Cody even tighter before he stands, sliding into the chair next to Cody. He props his head onto his hands, scratching idly at one cheek, and Cody picks the datapad back up, opening the next file. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay. I can do this for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I want to stay.\u201d Obi-Wan slumps forward with a sigh, stretching his arms across the console until his palms press against the wall. He blinks up at the dark screen and then turns his gaze towards Cody. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this for me either.\u201d\n\u201cI want to.\u201d\nObi-Wan carefully rises to his feet, the chair sliding back on its rails as he does so. \u201cI\u2019ll get us both something to drink. Would you like caf?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nObi-Wan leans down and Cody turns his head without a thought to kiss him. It\u2019s quick, a barely-there brush of their lips before Obi-Wan draws back, blinking. \u201cYes?\u201d he murmurs, his lips parted and his breath is sweet, a lingering floral scent from his tea several hours ago.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cody answers and leans forward to kiss him again."

        "comment": "The war is over. Mostly over.\nA droid staggers sideways out of the gloom and Cody swings his fist at it\u2019s head, barely pausing in his deliberate trudge forwards. The impact is muted, not just by the layers of plastoid around his hand or the heavy leather gloves that cut off his connection to everything, but by the sensation that Cody isn\u2019t the one urging his body forward. There had been a comm message, a huddled figure in blue fragmented wireframe telling him to do\u2026 something.\nNo. Not him.\nThe order had been for CC-2224 and Cody hadn\u2019t been CC-2224 for a very long time. CC-2224 died in the same instance that Cody had turned on the squeaking floor of a new battleship, his helmet clipped to his belt for all the good that the scrubbers in his filters did to remove the tang of fresh solder, and he had seen Obi-Wan for the first time. He can\u2019t remember the moment in any great detail; his thoughts skitter away as if he\u2019s trying to remember a lifetime brewed into a minute, but he hadn\u2019t noticed the loss of CC-2224 until weeks later. That he could remember well, the scrap of flimsiwork trying to coax him back to Kamino for a routine procedure now that he was Republic property and not theirs. He\u2019d lost the recall notice, immediately, into the fresher sink and ran the water until the pipes ran clear and the notice would have been nothing more than a distant memory if Cody hadn\u2019t been completely and utterly himself.\nWhat had the comm been?\nIt must have been important although he didn\u2019t fully recognise the voice on the other end. Throughout the course of the war, and it had been a long course, doubling back to planets they had already been to because some bastards couldn\u2019t realise when they\u2019d been beaten, Cody had spoken to what felt like every single politician from here to the Outer Rim who had managed to squeeze themselves into sickly sweet politeness as they had shaken Cody\u2019s hand and then congratulated him on \u2018doing such a fine job for a clone\u2019. Cody had smiled and nodded and imagined shooting them between the eyes. Fox had confessed over slightly too many drinks balanced out with some very strong coffees, that he imagined stabbing them, his eyes a little too wild for Cody to think he was being anything other than completely serious.\n\u201cCody!\u201d\nCody turns in an instant, thumbing the catch on his blaster and raising it in the same motion. Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t pause like he should at the raised weapon, continuing on his intercept trajectory, and Cody has a moment to sigh out an exasperated \u201cGeneral,\u201d before Obi-Wan crashes into him. He\u2019s warm, solid beneath his layers of fabric, and it\u2019s a wonder that he\u2019s still got his robes on this late into a battle, but Cody leans into his embrace regardless, savouring the moment for as long as he can.\nIt never lasts long. They\u2019ve still got a job to do. Or do they?\n\u201cGeneral, did you get a comm?\u201d Cody speaks into Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder, his words muffled by the soft weave of the other man\u2019s robes. They taste of smoke, the sharp nebulous tang of ozone, and, beneath it all, the gentle florals of the Temple\u2019s laundry. He\u2019s still holding his blaster, now crushed between them, and Cody can feel Obi-Wan\u2019s heart beat alongside his own\nObi-Wan draws back just enough to cup Cody\u2019s face between his palms, his thumb smoothing over the raised edge of his scar. The whites of Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes are bissected with broken red veins, but the blue is as vibrant as ever, the same shade as the holographs on their communicators.\n\u201cDid you get a comm, Cody?\u201d\nCody, unwilling to do anything that would disrupt Obi-Wan\u2019s hands, his own somehow wound through Obi-Wan\u2019s belt to hold him impossibly closer, says, \u201cYes.\u201d\nThey had been close before, an undercurrent of helpless yearning for something they couldn\u2019t name, but this felt different. The war had ended. They were standing in the \u2018after\u2019.\n\u201cI wanted to do this properly but\u2026 forgive me?\u201d\nObi-Wan leans forward and kisses him, roughly, their noses bumping together before Obi-Wan tips his head to get a better angle and Cody moves with him. He hasn\u2019t closed his eyes and his vision blurs, the deep hue of Obi-Wan\u2019s hair blending with the sunset behind him. The other man\u2019s beard scratches against Cody\u2019s cheeks as his mouth moves, and Cody huffs out a quiet noise in question. Obi-Wan\u2019s thumb brushes over Cody\u2019s cheek, and he could pull away but he doesn\u2019t want to. He wants nothing less than this.\nSomething snaps in the back of his mind and Cody gasps against Obi-Wan\u2019s mouth, sagging in his hold, and Obi-Wan draws back, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love, I wanted to kiss you for the first time properly, after a true date, but I\u2026 there\u2019s a chip in your head.\u201d\n\u201cOw,\u201d Cody groans, solidly knocking his forehead against Obi-Wan\u2019s and feeling the reverberation in his teeth. \u201cA slave chip?\u201d\n\u201cControl. There\u2019s already been a few fights but for the most part, it seems like the activation was a failure. I wanted to kiss you, truly, I did, but it also helped me break the chip.\u201d\nCody breathes out slowly, prodding his tongue against the swell of his lower lip. \u201cAre you going to have to kiss the entire army for this?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s cheeks flushed a brilliant shade of pink. This close, Cody could almost feel the heat radiating from his skin. \u201cIt was faster for you this way. And I did want to.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to again?\u201d Cody waits for Obi-Wan to nod before he leans forward to kiss him for the second time, gentler this time. He\u2019s always been a quick study, after all."

        "comment": "\u201cHere.\u201d\nCody barely has a moment to register the pressure of Obi-Wan\u2019s hand around his wrist before he\u2019s pulled sideways. The door slides shut behind them with a click that echoes in the recesses of Cody\u2019s brain, the final notch in a tally he\u2019s been keeping since he first walked onto the bridge and saw Obi-Wan. He is completely and utterly fucked.\nThe cupboard \u2014 because calling it anything else would be an insult \u2014 is lined on both walls with shelving. Cody blinks in the sudden and complete darkness, waiting for his eyes to adjust. His helmet lies discarded somewhere on a higher level, a lucky shot cracking the visor and rendering it unusable, but the small beacon wired into it would still be active and they would be found. Eventually. Cody may be dead by then, his heart which carries by itself a price tag of seven hundred credits giving out due to the strain of how close Obi-Wan is to him. He can make out the flutter of Obi-Wan\u2019s lashes, the faint floral scent that clings to his breath as he sighs, his mouth pursing into a faint whistle.\nIt is how they trained them in Kamino, whistles and hand gestures, twisting them one way and then the other like a pack of hunting shrills, and Cody looks where Obi-Wan indicates. He can just make out the impression of his hand, one still wrapped around Cody\u2019s wrist, the blunt reflective sheen of a callus that swallows up the side of his thumb, before Obi-Wan releases him. His hand falls to his side and Cody misses the moment of contact. It would be for the best. He is used to surviving on rations stretched as far as they could go and Obi-Wan\u2019s touch could be divided up similarly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs. His face is tipped towards Cody\u2019s ear, his hair falling free from the rough bun he had hurriedly tidied himself into before they stepped onto the ship and the strands fall across Cody\u2019s shoulder like a tidal wave. There\u2019s an absence of scent to it, the neutral nothingness that comes with the products supplied to the clones, and Cody\u2019s thoughts slowly tip into Obi-Wan in the showers before he tears himself back into rote procedure.\nHe\u2019s dead. He is never going to leave this cupboard.\nCody swallows and the sound echoes in the cavern of his skull, too loud to be anything other than a point blank blaster cocked against his temple. \u201cSorry for what, sir?\u201d\nObi-Wan catches himself on the edge of a laugh, biting it back as his shoulders shake. He lowers his head, pressing his forehead to Cody\u2019s shoulder before he breathes in and straightens up once more. Grief breaks into fragments across his brow blending with the lingering joy, his lower lip caught between his teeth. He clears his throat softly and Cody\u2019s attention snapping back to him. \u201cI should have tried to pick a better hiding spot,\u201d Obi-Wan says, an apology layered beneath his words. He presses his regrets into Cody\u2019s hip, the motion hidden from the door by the bulk of their bodies and the fall of Obi-Wan\u2019s robes, close but still apart.\n\u201cNext time, I\u2019d like one that has a caf machine installed.\u201d Cody leans into Obi-Wan\u2019s touch still. It is like he is starving, trying to tear himself away from a banquet. He can carve half-moons into his flesh from the jagged edges of his nails and sear the brush of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingertips into his bones and it will never be enough. He wants to kiss him, but he can\u2019t. Cody is a good soldier, he follows his orders, and Obi-Wan is his General. There isn\u2019t a space for them yet, not here, not like this.\n\u201cI will try my best in the future.\u201d\nThey are silent for a long moment. Distantly, the wail of an alarm begins to sound and the light bleeding through the narrow gap of the doors flickers a deep red. In the fresh hue, Cody looks up at Obi-Wan, meeting his gaze. \u201cWhat are you thinking, sir?\u201d\n\u201cLots of things,\u201d Obi-Wan answers automatically. His mouth curves into a small smile that doesn\u2019t go anywhere near his eyes, the same expression he wears when a politician breaks into his orbit, manufactured politeness brandished like a saber to get them away from him. Cody doesn\u2019t know what the Force feels like, how an entire universe's worth of input could cram itself into a single person\u2019s mind, but he squeezes Obi-Wan\u2019s hand. A tremor runs through the other man, a realigning of planets because of Cody\u2019s touch and he wonders if the Force feels better than this, if shifting the flow of the universe could compare to holding Obi-Wan\u2019s hand.\nObi-Wan continues, his voice perfectly level in stark opposition to the shiver rattling his teeth. \u201cI am thinking that I really would like to kiss you.\u201d\nCody starts, his breath tearing through his chest before he rights himself in the same moment, perfected Kaminoan engineering at work. \u201cI\u2019d like you to kiss me.\u201d\n\u201cNot like this, but\u2014\u201d Obi-Wan cups Cody\u2019s jaw in his free hand, smoothing his thumb over Cody\u2019s cheek, \u201c\u2014hold still, love.\u201d\nCody obeys. The ship could fall out of the sky and every single one of his brothers could tear open the door to this cupboard and Cody wouldn\u2019t move. Obi-Wan leans closer, pressing his cheek to Cody\u2019s before he turns his face closer. He blinks deliberately, his lashes dragging against Cody\u2019s skin, his breath warm as he exhales, and Cody closes his eyes. He wants to remember this. It is an unconventional kiss, but they have never done things in the typical way.\nObi-Wan straightens slowly. \u201cI will be able to kiss you properly after the war.\u201d\n\u201cI liked that kiss,\u201d Cody murmurs, his voice cracking, his cheeks suddenly burning. Obi-Wan chuckles, squeezing Cody\u2019s hand once more.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d"

        "comment": "\u201cCody!\u201d\nRising on his toes at the call of his name, bracing his elbow against Rex\u2019s shoulder in order to steady himself and ignoring the grunt from the other man, Cody peers over the crowd. The majority are dressed in the dark robes of graduation, flashes of colour and pattern from the clothes of their visitors, but Cody could pick Obi-Wan out in a concert crowd of thousands. The other man has braced himself against one of the lampposts in the corner of the square, waving his arm frantically in the air.\nThe dark robes look good on him, hanging open except for the thin golden chain at his neck that holds it closed at the top. Beneath it, Obi-Wan wears a crisp white shirt and Cody bites back a laugh in recognition. He knows that shirt well, Obi-Wan had been frantically ironing it earlier that morning, the small board balanced across the back of the sofa as it had been one of the only clear spaces in the flat, a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth as he worked. Cody hadn\u2019t been in much of a better state, having lived in the same hoodie and trousers for the previous week while his final exam had drawn ever nearer, but he had still kept out of the way of both Obi-Wan and the trailing cord while he cooked them both breakfast. It had been nice, domestic almost, bringing back memories of when Cody had still lived in his childhood home without such mundane concerns like rent and groceries.\n\u201cObi-Wan!\u201d Cody waves his free hand, leaning more fully onto Rex to do so. Rex, a begrudging support, snaps something up at him that Cody doesn\u2019t bother to listen to, and widens his stance to better support Cody\u2019s weight. He drops down after another moment, luxuriating in the way Obi-Wan\u2019s grin had impossibly brightened even more after seeing him, uncaring that his own smile is beginning to cause his cheeks to ache. He\u2019s happy, deliriously, utterly happy.\nJango chuckles, his back pressed to the broader one of Seventeen, using his bulk to hide the trailing smoke from his cigarette as he breathes in and then out. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hang around us all the time. I\u2019ve got more than enough sons to be paternal to today if you want to go see your boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cNot my boyfriend,\u201d Cody informs him, casting a glance at his smoke that Jango ignores with the same ease Cody has inherited.\n\u201cLife partner then. Now, off you go.\u201d\nCody isn\u2019t about to let an opportunity like this slip through his fingers so he brushes a kiss against Jango\u2019s cheek and darts out of the close circle of his brothers and away across the crowded square. He twists around the other groups, careful to keep his shoulders in check and try to make his way across to Obi-Wan as unobtrusively as he could, but he doesn\u2019t know how successful he was. A scattered handful of glares pierce his back, a few exclamations of annoyance, but none of that matters as Cody reaches Obi-Wan, his hands already extended to help Cody up onto the pedestal of the lamppost next to him. His skin is warm, his hands rougher than Cody would have expected still given the purely the academic lean of his course, and Cody wraps an arm around his shoulder as Obi-Wan\u2019s grip falls to his waist, holding him securely.\n\u201cHello there,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs, his nose bumping against Cody\u2019s as they centre themselves on the limited space.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Cody pulls in a breath through his teeth, tasting the sharp artificial scent of Obi-Wan\u2019s shampoo \u2014 borrowed from Cody\u2019s apartment and he\u2019d never considered the impact of smelling something so familiar on someone else \u2014 and the rich scent of his cologne. There\u2019s a faint sheen over his collarbone from it and Cody presses his cheek against Obi-Wan\u2019s, hugging him tightly. \u201cI thought you would be with your family.\u201d\nObi-Wan chuckles, his breath warm against Cody\u2019s cheek as he leans into his hold. \u201cGrandfather is busy conducting a tour. I believe the student guide originally assigned the role is receiving quite the education on the history of the place, and Qui-Gon is joining him to reminisce about all the hijinks he has gotten up to. If we can make it to the ceremony without another feud erupting, then I will count the day as a success.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a low barrier for success,\u201d Cody teases, drawing back slightly. He doesn\u2019t move far, can\u2019t with their limited space beneath their feet and, even if he could, he wouldn\u2019t want to. The future that had been looming is barreling them towards them, both fragile and wide-eyed in the headlights. \u201cThough I can\u2019t say my classification is going to be any better.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It did make you easier to spot.\u201d Obi-Wan leans back, waving once more to the huddle of Cody\u2019s family. Cody looks as well, he can\u2019t pick out individual features from this distance but he can make out the uniform shade of their skin, the majority dressed in pale coloured shirts and dark trousers, and the dark colour of their hair. They stand out and Cody grumbles something into Obi-Wan\u2019s collar. \u201cRex is shouting something to you.\u201d\nCody, reluctantly, looks.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him. Obi-Wan, let me down.\u201d\nObi-Wan bites the tip of his tongue as he fights back his laughter, his shoulders shaking. His grip tightens on Cody\u2019s waist, keeping him close. \u201cWe could always\u2026 follow his suggestion? If you\u2019d like.\u201d\nCody straightens. He feels like he isn\u2019t breathing, like he hasn\u2019t taken a full breath since Obi-Wan first called his name and he surged across a courtyard to reach his side. \u201cIf I\u2019m kissing you, it\u2019s because I want to. Not because of my brother\u2019s suggestion.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you say, love.\u201d\nObi-Wan grins and lowers his mouth to Cody\u2019s who is also unable to stop smiling. The angle isn\u2019t right, the tilt of their heads restricted by their close quarters, but they laugh together, kissing in the sunshine. The future can wait for a little while longer; they\u2019re together here and now."

        "comment": "The cafe is crowded, not overtly so, but Cody still recalls his Arcanine to his ball before he ducks inside. The decoration is typical of most of the other\u2019s in this area, a few posters plastered over a noticeboard dominating one wall that catches Cody\u2019s eye before any of the other kitsch items can, and he\u2019s already ducking his head and turning away before he can fully register what he\u2019s seeing. There are only so many times that he can stand seeing his own face depicted in glorious technicolour, the scar that runs over his temple only included at his insistence, before he\u2019ll flee back to his apartment and refuse to leave it for another week. He had only wanted to complete his badges and make sure his Pokemon were happy, everything else is\nextra\n.\nCody tugs his cap down further over his face and turns towards one of the tables tucked away to the side. He catches Dex\u2019s eye as he goes, the owner peering over the glass top of the counter, his Machamp looming over his side and, for a moment, Dex\u2019s shadow possesses four arms settled on his hips. Dex waves one broad hand in greeting, his Machamp already beginning to make up a couple of dishes, and Cody returns the motion with a small salute before he returns his attention towards the table. He slides onto the seat facing away from the window, the imagined itch of eyes branded into the back of his neck already. Once he is situated, Cody thumbs the button of his Pokeball, careful to keep the ball down by his side before returning it to his bag. His Arcanine yawns, his tongue lolling out of his mouth before he settles back on his haunches, expectantly. Cody reaches across to scratch behind his partner\u2019s ears, the Pokemon\u2019s tail knocking against the floor with low rhythmic thumps, before he leans against Cody\u2019s hand and settles back down onto the floor.\n\u201cCody!\u201d Dex crows as he bustles out from behind the counter, a stretch of plates splayed across one arm and a heavy mug clutched in his other hand. Steam billows from the mug and Cody\u2019s attention sticks to it, the distant memory of his morning cup already burning a hole in his stomach as it had been accompanied by very little else. He hadn\u2019t realised how hungry he was until this moment.\n\u201cDex,\u201d Cody answers, standing up to greet the other man properly once the plates had been distributed over the table. Dex\u2019s hugs were legendary like sinking into a warm bath with your belly full and a fire burning merrily in the fireplace. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\u201cBetter now that my favourite sponsor is here!\u201d Dex keeps his voice low but even that is loud enough for Cody to flinch, throwing his gaze towards the still-closed door.\nHe leans into Dex\u2019s hold, sneaking out one hand to fumble at one of the chips poking out of the basket. \u201cI\u2019m your only sponsor.\u201d Cody bites into the chip and near-enough moans. It\u2019s perfection, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavoured exactly how Cody likes them.\n\u201cThat you are,\u201d Dex chuckles, ruffling Cody\u2019s hair and finally releasing him. Cody\u2019s cheeks are flushed, embarrassment quick on the heels of any of his actions recently, but he still reaches for another chip, tucking himself back into his seat. Dex has also brought a bowl for his Arcanine, now sitting upright, his attention focused on that single spot, and he glances up at Cody, his paws clicking against the wood floor. Cody nods and at his signal, his Arcanine surges forwards, shoving his face into the bowl. His tail begins wagging again, impacting against the side of Cody\u2019s leg like a blow. He weathers it as best as he can, picking amongst the plates and setting a handful to one side. They weren\u2019t intended for him, after all.\nCody is about to reach for his phone, the phantom buzzing sensation now crawling over the back of his skull, when the door rings behind him, swinging open with a gust of frigid air that is only barely mitigated by the fire Pokemon at his side. He turns to inspect the person, initially a glance over his shoulder but he turns fully when he takes in the man pushing the door closed, his collar drawn up over his face. The Absol at his side shakes itself free of the lingering rain and pads over to Cody\u2019s table immediately, taking the most direct route by ducking beneath the tables and scrambling over one chair that had been left askew. Obi-Wan draws his scarf free, peeling the damp fabric away from his skin with a grimace and folds it on itself, draping it over his shoulder. His hair is dark with the rain, the colour diluted from auburn to a deep rich brown, and a small puddle forms at his feet, settling into the void of his shoes. He swipes a hand over his eyes, his gaze skimming over the handful of occupied tables before he settles onto Cody. Obi-Wan raises a hand in greeting, his grin immediate, and the gathered grey clouds and the ever-present gaze of the world didn\u2019t matter anymore.\nObi-Wan reaches him in a matter of moments, following the same pathway that his Absol did, and he leans down to hug Cody in the same moment. Cody\u2019s cap shifts to the side, exposing the scar wrapped across his temple, and Obi-Wan presses a kiss to it before Cody can begin to tense up. The ghost of his lips burns into Cody\u2019s skin as Obi-Wan adjusts his cap, pulling it back into place before he slides into his seat across from Cody. \u201cHello, love. Long time, no see.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d Cody manages. His heart feels restricted, somehow too full and wrung empty at the same time. He doesn\u2019t brush his fingers across the aching spot on his temple, the space he somehow hopes bruises so he\u2019ll have some physical to tie this memory to. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\nObi-Wan\u2019s smile shifts into something soft and sweet. He reaches out through the network of plates to twine his fingers through Cody\u2019s, his thumb working over the calluses on his palm. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too. Let\u2019s not part again.\u201d"

        "post_title": "Obi-Wan has been pining after his coworker Cody since they began working together. With the aid of some mistletoe, he decides to do something about it.",
        "comment": "The bell above the door chimes and Obi-Wan swallows back a groan along with the scaldingly sweet dregs of his drink. The limited edition syrups wash over his palette with all of the subtlety of the line woven around the scant handful of tables, expectant eyes locking onto Obi-Wan. It isn\u2019t too far away from how he watches Cody; a desperate clawing hunger that can only be blunted and never satiated, and Obi-Wan smiles at the next customer in the queue, an old ache beginning to burrow into his cheeks.\n\u201cWelcome! What can I get for you?\u201d\nIn the moments between, amongst the hissing rush of steam from the failing coffee machine and the whir of the grinder that makes its displeasure known each and every time it deigns to function, Obi-Wan watches Cody. His apron is neatly tied around his waist, the deep red of the festive accessories perfectly complimenting his dark eyes and hair, the golden wash of glitter streaked over his cheekbones, and his shirt has something emblazoned across it beneath his apron that Obi-Wan can just make out the shape of. A mug lands on the saucer in front of Obi-Wan, mismatched red to the delicate floral pattern emblazoned around the rim of the plate, and he blinks down at it, his thoughts disrupted and crashing into each other in one glorious pile-up. He has the large iced mocha already set to one side, just waiting the whipped cream and skin-staining sprinkles to adorn it, and the triple shot latte which barely passes muster but he knows the dead-eyed stare of the regular well enough by now and he can remember his own days as a student vividly so he doesn\u2019t argue, so what is the newest concoction that Cody had delivered to him? He glances up, raising his brows at Cody in a silent question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Cody calls, grinning widely over at Obi-Wan and his heart stutters to an expectant stop in his chest, restarting when Obi-Wan coughs, a flush overtaking his face, and he looks away. Cody continues, unperturbed. \u201cLet me know what you think.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t much of a lull during the festive season, what would have been long stretches of time with minimal foot traffic and too many hours since his break and to quitting time at once are now disjointed and impossible to predict. The mug sits untouched until the current rush subsides, barely enough space to think let alone hide behind the bulk of the coffee machine to sip at the mug. It haunts him, however, the thought of it innocently huddled on the counterr, doing nothing more than existing but Obi-Wan is consumed by it. \u201cThank you!\u201d Obi-Wan repeats, his grin verging on plastic, as artificial as the sweetness lingering over the back of his tongue and the canned music spilling from the speakers. It is a small mercy that it is a collection of instrumental tracks instead of the hit singles that would make his ears bleed by the second shift.\nCody hums along with the music, punctuating the beat by tapping a pen against the top of the register. It is a heavyset machine, the buttons polished to high sheen, and the gentle hits from Cody reverberate dully beneath the offbeat tune. Obi-Wan drifts back to his usual spot and picks up the mug. It\u2019s cooled somewhat but still has some warmth lingering so Obi-Wan sets his back against the counter as he picks it up, shielding himself from any potential customers who would wander in for the next couple of minutes. The drink is sweet, warmed through with spices and Obi-Wan groans into the mug, tipping his head back as he drains it.\n\u201cGood?\u201d Cody slides along the counter, picking up a cloth from the cleaning solution and beginning to wipe down the already clean wood. He\u2019s a line of heat against Obi-Wan\u2019s side, a blessing given the thin fabric of his shirt as he had discarded his jumper into the breakroom several hours ago.\nObi-Wan nods, his teeth knocking against the edge of the mug as he does so. He licks his lips, chasing remnants of the drink. \u201cVery. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how we got that gingerbread syrup that tastes more like faintly sweet nothing?\u201d\nObi-Wan nods, shifting to lean further into Cody.\n\u201cI made my own.\u201d Cody shrugs, trying to downplay his creation, but there\u2019s a flush over the tips of his ears and his gaze sneaks back to inspect the mug in Obi-Wan\u2019s hands too many times to be pure coincidence.\n\u201cYou are a wonder, Cody.\u201d\nThe bell rings and they both lean out around the machine, relaxing back when they recognise a familiar face, Rex\u2019s blonde hair mussed from the damp cap held in one hand as he knocks his boots clean. Rex snorts and Cody leans back out, the cloth balled up in his hand and ready to be thrown despite the deliberate casual lean against the clounter. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re beneath mistletoe, right? Bad luck to break tradition.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t save him from the cloth thrown at his head and Rex ducks with a laugh. Cody rocks back onto his heels but Obi-Wan isn\u2019t looking, tracking his movement out of the corner of his eye. Rex is right. The plant is innocuous, a cluster of pale berries amongst the dark green sweep of the leaves, all tied up above Obi-Wan and Cody with a neat red ribbon.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Cody sighs. He scrubs a hand through his curls, biting at the tip of his tongue. Obi-Wan waits, his heart in his throat, his mind empty, and Cody glances over at him. \u201cWould\u2013 Can I kiss you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nCody cups Obi-Wan\u2019s jaw, drawing him down into a kiss. It\u2019s everything Obi-Wan had hoped it would be and his hands fall to Cody\u2019s waist, gathering his apron in the desperate press of his palms. It\u2019s soft and sweet and Obi-Wan hums low in his throat, leaning closer. Breaking away, Cody leans back in and kisses Obi-Wan once more, his grin wide enough to\nhurt\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a while,\u201d Cody murmurs against Obi-Wan\u2019s mouth. He rocks back on his heels and tugs the neck of his apron down to reveal a graphic of mistletoe inverted. \u201cStarted to feel a little desperate.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Rex calls and Cody curses at him as Obi-Wan folds into laughter, pressing his hands to his burning cheeks."

        "comment": "Cody taps his scoop of caf against the side of his cup, the powder falling free with a soft thump. A few particles drift free, dark against the pale surface of the small kitchenette unit installed in the corner of Obi-Wan\u2019s rooms, and Cody notes their presence the same way he would track the individual pin-pricks of troops across a map. It\u2019s light duties, stamped in his file with a liberal amount of glee by a medic who clutched their cup of their caf until their knuckles went white, and he\u2019s been following that to the letter. It\u2019s how they were trained after all.\nIt\u2019s every space between the letters that he\u2019s having difficulty with.\nAlong with the assigned light duties, ostensibly to recover the brain surgery and actually to stop Cody from dismantling exactly why the Senate\u2019s policy was karking banthashit to their faces, Cody had little to do and even less of an idea about what he could do. He arrived at Obi-Wan\u2019s door one morning, his discharge papers crumpled up in his fist and a headache that had nothing to do with the chip that had been removed and everything with the fact he hadn\u2019t had a sip of caf for a week, and he had never left.\nHe isn\u2019t sure what that makes them now.\nThey have been Commander and General for so long that to be anything else nearly can\u2019t be thought about. There is a missing piece of Cody\u2019s brain, a sinkhole for his thoughts to pour into in hopes of filling it back up, and he tips his worries about Obi-Wan into it so they don\u2019t infest somewhere else. He is in love with Obi-Wan. He has been since that first battlefield with blood pouring down the side of his face and he didn\u2019t know if he even had his eye still. Obi-Wan had cupped his face between his palms for an instant before pressing his knuckles to the bleeding hollow on the side of his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, love,\u201d Obi-Wan had murmured, grinning down at Cody and he had believed him. He had been right which had only cemented the knowledge that Cody had been right then, and he is right now.\nThe kettle hisses as it boils and Cody picks it up, hooking his fingers beneath the handle and pouring some into the mug. Reflexively, he steps back, drawing the small timer up from the shelf beneath the counter before he catches himself. Obi-Wan is at a Council meeting that morning and for the rest of the day, there is only a single cup needed this morning instead of the delicate process of brewing and steeping and stirring that Cody has dedicated himself to the study of for Obi-Wan\u2019s preferred morning cup of tea.\nCody places the kettle back down, nudging the base flush against the wall, and returns the timer to the shelf. He stirs his own cup as he rifles through the growing collection of extras flavourings that Obi-Wan has added to his own supply of different teas and pulls out a sweet pod, dropping it into his mug. It cracks open beneath the surface, a few luminescent pearls floating to the surface. Cody scoops one up with his spoon and sips at it, cracking the pearl between his teeth. It matches well, the caf rich and dark and the pearl a burst of needed sweetness. He scoops up his mug, throwing the spoon into the sink, and turns towards the sunken sitting area. There is a spread of files across the low table, the curling corners of the flimsiwork nearly the same pale shade of the table but broken by lines and lines of cramped neat text, and the pit of Cody\u2019s stomach falls out.\nHe knows those files.\nObi-Wan needs those files. He\u2019d poured over them for hours for the past few weeks, adding his own notations and thoughts to the already layered margins, his hair dishevelled from the disjointed push of his fingers as he paces to rehearse his arguments. It had been beautiful to watch him work in an entirely different battlefield to the one Cody is used to seeing, words forged into weapons, some as delicate as a blade and others a cudgel to hit his point home further. Cody picks up a travel mug, tipping his caf into it, and seals the lid with a quick swipe of his thumb, moving down to the table to pick up the files. They\u2019re heavier than he expects, a dull ache throbbing across his temple as he wavers, knocking the flimsiwork against his hip until the file is mostly closed. He\u2019ll just need to be careful to not drop any.\nCody hesitates in front of the door, pressing his tongue against the jagged line of his canine. His breath is heavy in his chest, drawing him down to the floor, and he could just stay here. Obi-Wan wouldn\u2019t mind if Cody couldn\u2019t leave their rooms before he was ready, but he wants to do this. He cares for Obi-Wan, loves him with every choice he has ever made, and he wants to be able to bring him his files that the other man has forgotten just because he could. Cody taps the door controls, takes a swig of his caf, and steps out into the corridor. He doesn\u2019t stop walking.\nThe Jedi Temple hums with activity, still somehow peaceful despite the footsteps echoing through the corridors and the rumble of voices that spill out of the rooms. Cody keeps close to one wall, following it like a battleplan, and only breaking away to turn down one intersection or another. The doors to the Council rooms hang open, several familiar voices leaking out before Cody\u2019s attention catches onto Obi-Wan\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just be a moment, thank you!\u201d Obi-Wan bows as he walks backwards, tipping his hip around the catch of the door and spinning with the same movement. His face lights up as he sees Cody, his grin only widening as his gaze drops to the file Cody holds against his hip. \u201cYou brought my file? You wonderful man.\u201d He crosses the distance between them in a handful of steps, cupping Cody\u2019s face in his palms. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\nObi-Wan leans forward and kisses him, already moving to pluck the file from his arms. Cody, his mind empty, his eyes wide, lets him and Obi-Wan walks away. He doesn\u2019t get further than two steps before he freezes, both hands rising to cover his face before Obi-Wan turns back around. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cody. I shouldn\u2019t have, not without asking, I just\u2014\u201d\nCody cuts him off, closing the distance between them again, and tugs the file down so he can rise onto his toes and kiss Obi-Wan again. Properly this time."

        "post_title": "Cody tries to break Obi-Wan's curse.",
        "comment": "The window groans as Cody pushes it open, the sound barely muffled by the rag stuffed into the hinges, once a decorative cast-off from a larger dress and now sacrificed for the mundane concerns of darkness and warmth. Outside, the moon hangs low in the sky, barely brushing the dark spikes of the trees and the path Cody needs to take is well-illuminated, the occasional smooth stone glowing bright in the moonlight. He doesn\u2019t need them, not now, not after so many years walking the same path.\n\u201cAre you out again?\u201d The voice is familiar, but it takes Cody a moment to place it, blinking back into the dappled shadows of the bedroom. A wavering afterimage of his path hovers in front of his gaze and he waits for it to pass before he locks eyes with Rex, his hair already rumpled and his eyes barely open.\nCody nods.\nRex groans, pressing his hands to his eyes and sinking back into the bed. He reaches over, smacking his hand against the mattress until he retrieves Cody\u2019s blanket and pulls it over himself. \u201cHow many times are you going to keep this up, Codes?\u201d Rex sighs heavily, the sound verging on a snore. \u201cStay safe.\u201d\nCody couldn\u2019t answer him, not like this. He can feel every trapped word vibrating in his chest, soil left to grow overgrown and treacherous, but he nods again, and scrambles out of the window. There are a lot of unknowns with this curse, too many in fact for him to ever be sure that he is even helping, but he stays the course regardless. His family had argued over his decision, over his head, to his face, tucked in the small corners of their home when they thought he couldn\u2019t hear them, but Cody is stubborn. He could do this, he could help in this small way, so he doesn\u2019t speak.\nGrunts of effort, he is reasonably sure, don\u2019t count, tied in to sobs and gasps, yawns and every other involuntary noise that a body makes, but he hasn\u2019t spoken an intentional word in years. He ducks beneath a tree bough that only caught him at the beginning of his travels back and forth and every so often when he still forgot about it, and pushes his way through a tangle of the undergrowth. The lake is still, perfectly flat and it reflects the moon overhead like a mirror. Cody sinks onto an upturned log. Over the years, he has seen it sink further into the ground, the rapid flash of moss over the surface seeming to bloom and develop infrastructure and revolution in a matter of weeks. He pulls the treated cloth bag out from the hollow next to it and sets to work. His earlier work is clumsy, random inexplicable holes scattered across the surface of the fabric, his stitches ragged and bisecting the uneven colours of the fabric, but he improved. His current shirt is a thing of beauty, the fabric nearly glowing beneath the watchful gaze of the moon and Cody\u2019s stitches are neat and even. One sleeve hangs free and then everything will be complete.\nHe lowers his head and begins to work.\nSometime later, Cody\u2019s eyes burning and his vision beginning to waver in and out of focus, a distant splash catches Cody\u2019s attention and he looks up across the lake. The ripple meets the shore at the same time, continuing as the swan breaks away from the group and travels towards Cody.\n\u201cYou came.\u201d Cody hears the words without hearing them, a stray thought emblazoned across the front of his mind, and he grins at the animal as it stumbles onto the shore. There\u2019s a scent of cool water and a lingering bite of salt, the memories of a world so far away it might not exist at all, and Cody nods, holding up the shirt in trembling hands. It doesn\u2019t feel real, being so close and yet still so far.\nThe swan\u2019s wings flex, power clear in the movement, and the feathers gleam. The curse hadn\u2019t detracted from the man\u2019s beauty, merely transposed it onto a different form. Cody had only met the man once, slumped beneath a tree with blood soaking through his tunic and feathers already beginning to poke through his skin. His hair had been caught between silver and his likely natural red, but his eyes had been clear enough. Cody remembers the clasp of his hand, tight enough to ache, to try and imprint some semblance of his fading humanity onto another person before the curse had overtaken him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re nearly finished, I\u2014 We\u2014 Thank you. Thank you for everything.\u201d\nCody lowers his gaze once more, a flush of heat rolling through his cheeks, and pulls his needle through the fabric once, twice, three more times. He bites through the thread, a tiny snap he feels echoing through his mind, and shakes out the shirt, holding it out to the swan. He tips his head to one side, shrugging with an exaggerated rise of his shoulders. Nothing is happening. He finished the task, sewed the shirts, and didn\u2019t speak. He fulfilled the criteria the man had whispered to him, a voice torn between a swan\u2019s call and ragged syllables.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d The swan waddles forward, lowering his head to poke the shirt with his beak. \u201cThis should have worked.\u201d He steps forward, stretching out his wings to knock against Cody\u2019s hands as he lowers the shirt.\nGrief is heavy and it tears through Cody\u2019s shirt. This should have worked. Was it him, his fault? Had he spoken during his silence and ruined everything?\n\u201cThank you, Cody. For everything.\u201d The swan leans forward, resting his neck against Cody\u2019s shoulders, his wings against Cody\u2019s arms. His feathers are cool beneath Cody\u2019s touch, and he turns his face into the embrace, kissing the top of the swan\u2019s head by way of an apology. It tastes like salt, like tears and sorrow. \u201cSleep now. I will discuss with the others for a solution.\u201d\nCody, exhausted and hollow, nods, sinking to the ground and curling onto his side. He rolls, facing away from the lake, unable to face them any longer.\nHe\u2019s awoken by a shout, heard and not thought, sitting upright.\n\u201cCody! It worked!\u201d The man stands at the shore, the remnants of a tattered tunic over his torso and one of Cody\u2019s shirts over the top of it. It fits him well. His grin is bright as the rising sun and he staggers towards Cody, half-hunched forward before he straightens, his legs trembling from the effort. He collapses next to Cody, crawls the final few steps and cups Cody\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cIt worked, thank you.\u201d\nBehind him, Cody can make out other human forms on the shore, one man sprawled across the ground, his hands splayed towards the sky, and another staggering on legs that he\u2019s determined will hold him up.\nCody swallows, presses his tongue against his lower lip. \u201cHi.\u201d His voice cracks, barely louder than a whisper.\n\u201cHi, love.\u201d\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d Cody asks, carefully picking his way around the words he hasn\u2019t used for years but has wanted to ever since he saw the man in the forest.\n\u201cYes. Yes, please.\u201d\nCody leans forward and kisses him, tastes salt and joy and everything is going to be okay."

        "comment": "The vaporater groans through another automated maintenance cycle, a flash of lights along the side flickering orange and then, regrettably, red. Cody twists the wrench round in his palm, the crack in the wooden handle cutting into his skin before he adjusts it, and crouches back down on his haunches. Sweat prickles along the nape of his neck, soaking into the hood he\u2019s drawn up over his head as the suns crept higher in the sky, and there\u2019s a scratch in his throat that\u2019s been demanding to be addressed for nearly as long. He swallows, a click echoing in the confines of his thoughts like a blaster hitting empty, fired again and again and again, and\u2014\nVaporater. The vaporater is broken. He is fixing it. Obi-Wan is in town and will be back soon.\nCody isn\u2019t at war, not anymore.\nHe tugs the panel open once more, revealing a heavy network of gears, some slowly rotating in place but the majority are still, shuddering in their casing. A thin stream of smoke pools forth from one of the lower sections, the scent thick despite appearances and Cody coughs, smacking his hand against the control panel to turn the vaporater off. On the back of his tongue, the scent lingers, purely mechanical in nature, and it is that thought that bothers Cody more than having to be out here, a speck in a desert that still remembers it used to be an ocean and has been cultivating a resentment for an eternity. It had been a lifetime since Cody had first gone into combat, but he remembers the way a droid twitched when it fell, a splutter of sparks like a final gasp falling from the hole Cody had just shot into it. It smelt the same.\nCody shoves the wrench against the sticking gear, rising up onto his knees to press his body weight against the thin lever, already a little broken, a little make-do and he should be more careful with it but his thoughts tangle up in the heavy footsteps of an enemy that\u2019s been decommissioned for decades, and he pushes. The gear gives way, the crack in the handle widens, and Cody hits the control switch once more. The lights flicker orange then green.\n\u201cCody!\u201d\nCody turns, a twinge of pain in his back, an answering echo in his knee, and shades his eyes. Obi-Wan raises his hand in greeting, lopsided due to the heavy pack balanced on his hip. He\u2019s thrown his cloak back and his hair catches the sunlight, turning the silver brushed through his temples a deep golden hue. His grin is wide, unrestrained and beautiful, Cody\u2019s heart stuttering to an abrupt halt and restarting when Obi-Wan reaches him, leaning down to wrap his free arm around Cody\u2019s shoulders in a tight embrace. His skin is flushed and his breath is strained but he hums as Cody reaches up to squeeze Obi-Wan\u2019s hand with his own.\n\u201cDid you fix it?\u201d Obi-Wan shifts his pack with a grunt, tipping his head to one side \u2014 closer to Cody, some strands of his hair falling free to brush against Cody\u2019s forehead and he\u2019s surrounded, comforted right down to his bones, worn thin as they are.\nCody nods, flicking the panel closed and dropping the wrench back into the toolbox. The crack in the handle gleams bright in the sunlight, a dark line bitten into his palm and he curls his hand into a fist. \u201cI think so. Temporarily at least.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Obi-Wan stands uneasily, bracing himself against Cody\u2019s shoulder as he halts part of the way. His lip curls, his eyes wide and focused on nothing except the pain lancing up and down his spine. The moment passes, it always does, and Obi-Wan relaxes into his stance. There\u2019s a ghost of his saber at his hip and his hand lingers before he adjusts the pack once more. \u201cShall we go inside? I have something for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to,\u201d Cody says reflexively, every reaction braided into his genes rewired to the life he has found himself in, the space he had carved out a section of his skull and defected from his purpose to find. There\u2019s something warm in his chest despite his denial, a ember he has carried and nursed ever since he\u2019d turned on his heel in the sterile stretch of a command deck and bumped into the man who would be his General, his Jedi, his Obi-Wan.\nHe\u2019d never said anything, but, as Obi-Wan holds his hand out for Cody to take, perfectly in step with each other, even now, both older than they had ever thought possible, he doesn\u2019t think he needs to. Obi-Wan knows, they both know. All that remains is the first step.\n\u201cI wanted to,\u201d Obi-Wan says. His hand lingers in Cody\u2019s, the pads of his fingers rough and the calluses across the stretch of his palm catching on the topography of Cody\u2019s skin, and he pulls away as they step across the threshold into their home.\nCody sighs, peeling the sodden fabric from his head and scrubbing a hand over his head to try and knock some of the sand free as he lingers in the entryway. The hut is cool, dappled in shadow as Obi-Wan draws the slats back on the small window overlooking the huddled kitchen and shoulders his pack onto the table. The wood groans beneath the weight and Cody moves over, snapping the fastenings open.\n\u201cThere.\u201d Obi-Wan points to the package resting on top of everything else. It\u2019s small and lovingly wrapped in a cloth patterned with geometric lines crossing over each other. \u201cI hope it isn\u2019t squashed, I tried so hard to make sure it was safe.\u201d\nCody nods, his mouth dry, his mind empty except for a distant ringing as he picks up the package. There\u2019s a heft to it despite the small size and his fingers slip as he begins to pick at the knot, drawing the fabric free. Beyond him, Obi-Wan begins to unpack the bag, the gentle rustling of packages filling the quiet sanctuary of their home. The fabric falls free and Cody blinks up at Obi-Wan.\n\u201cFruit?\u201d\nObi-Wan nods, rocking back onto his heels, his hands clasped in front of him. His thumb worries over the knuckle of his opposite hand and he chews on the inside of his cheek before he answers. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d\nCody blinks past a haze of tears \u2014 he\u2019s a soldier, he\u2019s cut a chip out of his brain without anything in his chest except rage, and he\u2019s mourned more losses than he could remember even with enhancements, but a fruit from Kamino in the middle of a desert is enough to break him completely \u2014 and nods, lowering his head. He raises the fruit to his mouth and bites down. Juice floods his mouth, escaping down his cheeks and onto the fabric and he chases after it, tasting a home he never thought he would know again.\nSniffing, he glances up at Obi-Wan, carefully turned away at the sink, busying himself with the already clean dishware. \u201cThank you.\u201d He chews, swallows, and presses his thumb to the edge of the bitten section, watching the flesh dimple beneath his touch, a rush of dark liquid flooding his nails. \u201cHave you ever had this before?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d Obi-Wan places the cup he had been holding back onto the counter.\n\u201cCome here. Try some.\u201d\n\u201cCody\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Cody holds out his hands, the fruit cupped between his palms and it is the same shade of blue as Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes, just as beautiful as he was the first day Cody met him. Obi-Wan chews his way around a chuckle and walks over. He cups his hands beneath Cody\u2019s and raises the fruit to his mouth, taking a small bite. It sounds wet and Obi-Wan raises his head, his mouth stained dark, and Cody leans forward to kiss him. Obi-Wan sighs, tipping his head to deepen the kiss, and it\u2019s sticky with juice, tasting sweet and Cody should have done this so much sooner."

        "comment": "Between one step and another, Obi-Wan stumbles into the control room of the Ventator. The walls are the same cold steel, slick with condensation and pitted with the rough-shod marks of quick construction, debris kicked away by every careless step, and the lights flicker the same way, a constant subtle tug of war between medical and engineering that he isn\u2019t meant to know anything about. Distantly, there is the rumble of generators that echo in the same timbre as the engines did, a rattle that lingers in the broken hollow of Obi-Wan\u2019s hip and sets his nerves sparking the same way a lover\u2019s touch would.\nHe knows he is on the Ventator because Cody is here.\nHe looks much the same as he had the last time Obi-Wan had seen him, shoulders rounded, his head bowed as he studies an incoming transmission. His teeth dig into his cheek the same way they always did whenever Cody fell into a rote pattern of concentration, the action drawing the faded tail end of his scar into uneasy relief, and Obi-Wan aches at the sight of him. He knows why so many of his fellow Jedi died when their clones turned on them because even now, as Cody\u2019s gaze slides up and locks onto his and Obi-Wan remembers exactly where he is, he can\u2019t picture himself hurting Cody.\nBut he may have to.\nObi-Wan steps backwards, takes another step. Cody watches him, his eyes dark. He isn\u2019t wearing his armour, any armour from what little Obi-Wan can make out, pressed into what passed as a dress uniform underneath this regime and was really little more than sharply creased tissue paper. He keeps his gaze fixed somewhere on Cody\u2019s navel, unable to look any higher, unwilling to look down. Cody\u2019s gloves are ripped along the seams at the side of his palms, the leather flexing open as his hands drop into Obi-Wan\u2019s sightline once more. There is a bacta patch affixed to the edge of one palm, cut to likely curl around his finger to try and mitigate any shifting during usual day-to-day wear.\nObi-Wan takes another step.\nCody follows him.\nHe isn\u2019t running, barely even retreating. This is recalculation, replanning, making things up as he goes because the universe has a particular fascination with tearing his life into shreds just to try and watch him pick up the pieces. Obi-Wan curls his fingers into the sodden twist of his sleeve, breathing through the whistle of his teeth as his jaw aches. His saber hangs heavy at his hip, weighed down with every responsibility Obi-Wan hadn\u2019t been able to carry and what he will have to do.\n\u201cGeneral?\u201d\nHe stops, his heart shattering on impact and leaking out through his boots. It squelches slightly as he steps forward, unable to stop himself even if what greets him would be a blaster bolt to his head. He\u2019s never been able to deny Cody anything, not really, not his attention, his thoughts, or his love even if he had been unable to tell him that.\n\u201cGeneral?\u201d Cody sounds so lost, far younger than he had ever been allowed to be. He digs his fingers into the broken seam of his gloves, stretching the tear further, another flash of golden skin made lighter by too long under artificial lights. (If Obi-Wan had found him sooner, Cody would be resplendent in sunlight, as bright as he should always be, not this shadowed side of the moon standing in front of him.)\n\u201cCody.\u201d\n\u201cYes\nNo\n.\u201d There is an undercurrent Cody\u2019s voice, a metallic quality infecting his words and trying to twist them to something else, a hiss of static over a commlink that sounds like whispers. His brow furrows, his gaze dropping to his boots, and Obi-Wan devours the opportunity to look over him properly. He\u2019s aged, his dark curls shot through with silver that darkens over the tips of his ears, and what little of Obi-Wan can see of his face has new wrinkles and scars in equal measure. He commits each one to memory, the cluster of creases at the corner of Cody\u2019s eye, the scar bisecting his eyebrow that\u2019s healed dark and jagged and the paler twin that just misses the twist of his mouth.\nCody drags his gaze up, his eyes bleeding dark confusion, his hands trembling when he had never hesitated before. \u201cWhy do you look scared of me? You don\u2019t normally.\nCome closer\n.\u201d\nThe datapad hangs from his fingers, the edge clicking against his knee. Text scrolls across it, too distant for Obi-Wan to be able to read, red gleaming against the dark background.\n\u201cWhat do you think I am, my\u2014 Cody?\u201d Obi-Wan swallows, apprehension tasting surprisingly like devotion.\n\u201cHallucination. A glitch in my programming.\nCome closer please.\u201d\nObi-Wan takes a single step forward. The light overhead flickers and Cody moves in the brief moment of darkness he\u2019s allotted, raising his hand to cup Obi-Wan\u2019s cheek and pausing before he makes contact. His hand is steady, as unwavering as his gaze, every part of him coordinated to the ticking of some distant machinery. Obi-Wan used to know where it was, the wind-up cogs in his chest ticking along with Cody\u2019s in synchronicity, but then Cody had tried to kill him.\nHe should have known it would happen.\nHe\u2019s meant for misery.\n\u201cShould have\u2014\u201c Cody clicks his tongue, his eyes drifting out of focus and inspecting the contours of Obi-Wan\u2019s spine before he blinks. The sound wisps across the forefront of Obi-Wan\u2019s mind, clinging like damp clings, staining the edges of his skull in a way he won\u2019t uncover for months. \u201cShould have kissed you earlier.\u201d\nEverything stops. A distant ringing echoes in Obi-Wan\u2019s ears, the speeder-brake squeal of a universe crashing into itself for the sake of this moment of stillness, of pure and complete clarity. He had always wondered if his love would have been returned if he had ever acted on it, if when an after the war Obi-Wan could live with was inflicted upon him that they could have had something, anything. This is a something, an anything.\n\u201cWould you\u2014\u201d Obi-Wan prods his lower lip with his tongue, tasting salt and sand. \u201cWould you like to kiss me now?\u201d\n\u201cNo\nYes.\u201d Cody answers promptly, holds his reasoning out to Obi-Wan like the past decades haven\u2019t happened, polished until he could count every hour of missed sleep in the purple stain beneath his eyes. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. You\u2019re not here.\u201d\nObi-Wan breathes in, testing the seams of his ribs, and leans down to kiss him. It\u2019s quick, barely more than a brush of his lips over Cody\u2019s, finished nearly before it begins. Cody\u2019s lips are dry, the surface rough, and Obi-Wan\u2019s melted heart breaks further, seeping into the soles of his boots. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe tips his head, pressing his cheek into Cody\u2019s hand, his skin cool due to the chill in the air. Cody\u2019s fingers curl, testing the seam of Obi-Wan\u2019s jaw, scratching the rough pads of his fingers over the growth of his beard.\u00a0 Obi-Wan breathes in, the memory of Cody\u2019s lips burning into his bones, and stretches a twist of the Force around his fingers, a single thread drawn as taut as he can without tearing down a floodgate and inviting the galaxy in. Cody blinks, a dawning horror in his eyes, a life lived and lost in a matter of seconds as his gaze fixes on Obi-Wan completely and utterly.\n\u201cSleep.\u201d\nCody sways, his lashes fluttering as his eyes roll. It takes him a few seconds to fall, crumpling as if Obi-Wan has set a charge at his joints, and Obi-Wan catches him, cradling Cody close. His mouth moves, a soundless gasp of disjointed syllables, before he sighs, succumving to the sleep that Obi-Wan has pulled over his mind. He looks younger in his sleep, the perpetual lines of worry wiped clear of his brow, and Obi-Wan presses a kiss to his curls as he sinks down to the floor with Cody. Knowing what he\u2019s lost is going to make living so much harder, but he has to do it. \u201cGoodbye, love. Stay safe.\u201d"
