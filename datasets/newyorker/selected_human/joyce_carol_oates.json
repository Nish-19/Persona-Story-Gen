        "comment": "The husband had got into the habit of calling the wife from somewhere in the house\u2014if she was upstairs, he was downstairs; if she was downstairs, he was upstairs\u2014and when she answered, \u201cYes? What?,\u201d he would continue to call her, as if he hadn\u2019t heard and with an air of strained patience: \u201cHello? Hello? Where are you?\u201d And so she had no choice but to hurry to him, wherever he was, elsewhere in the house, downstairs, upstairs, in the basement or outside on the deck, in the back yard or in the driveway. \u201cYes?\u201d she called, trying to remain calm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d And he would tell her\u2014a complaint, a remark, an observation, a reminder, a query\u2014and then, later, she would hear him calling again with a new urgency, \u201cHello? Hello? Where are you?,\u201d and she would call back, \u201cYes? What is it?,\u201d trying to determine where he was. He would continue to call, not hearing her, for he disliked wearing his hearing aid around the house, where there was only the wife to be heard. He complained that one of the little plastic devices in the shape of a snail hurt his ear, the tender inner ear was reddened and had even bled, and so he would call, pettishly, \u201cHello? Where are you?\u201d\u2014for the woman was always going off somewhere out of the range of his hearing, and he never knew where the hell she was or what she was doing; at times, her very being exasperated him\u2014until finally she gave in and ran breathless to search for him, and when he saw her he said reproachfully, \u201cWhere were you? I worry about you when you don\u2019t answer.\u201d And she said, laughing, trying to laugh, though none of this was funny, \u201cBut I was here all along!\u201d And he retorted, \u201cNo, you were not. You were not. I was here, and you were not here.\u201d And later that day, after his lunch and before his nap, unless it was before his lunch and after his nap, the wife heard the husband calling to her, \u201cHello? Hello? Where are you?,\u201d and the thought came to her, No. I will hide from him. But she would not do such a childish thing. Instead she stood on the stairs and cupped her hands to her mouth and called to him, \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m always here. Where else would I be?\u201d But the husband couldn\u2019t hear her and continued to call, \u201cHello? Hello? Where are you?,\u201d until at last she screamed, \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m here.\u201d But the husband couldn\u2019t hear and continued to call, \u201cHello? Where are you? Hello!,\u201d and finally the wife had no choice but to give in, for the husband was sounding vexed and angry and anxious. Descending the stairs, she tripped and fell, fell hard, and her neck was broken in an instant, and she died at the foot of the stairs, while in one of the downstairs rooms, or perhaps in the cellar, or on the deck at the rear of the house, the husband continued to call, with mounting urgency, \u201cHello? Hello? Where are you?\u201d\n\n",

        "comment": "\u201cHospice.\u201d\n\nOnce the word is uttered aloud, there is a seismic shift. You will feel it.\n\n\nLike a (very short) thread through the eye of a needle, swiftly in and swiftly out.\n\nThe air itself becomes thin, steely.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world. Paid subscribers get author interviews and poems.\n\nSign up\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAt the periphery of your vision, an immediate dimming. The penumbra begins to shrink. In time, it will become a tunnel. Ever diminishing. Until the remaining light is small enough to be cupped in two hands. And then it will be extinguished.\n\nFor when \u201chospice\u201d is spoken, the fact is at last acknowledged: There is no hope.\n\nNo hope. These words are obscene, unspeakable. To be without hope is to be without a future.\n\nWorse, by acknowledging that you are without a future, you have \u201cgiven up.\u201d\n\nAnd so when the word \u201chospice\u201d is first spoken\u2014carefully, cautiously, by a (female) palliative-care physician\u2014neither of you hears it. Or, if you hear it, you don\u2019t register that you have heard.\n\nA low-grade buzzing in the ears, a ringing, as of a distant alarm, an alarm in a shuttered room. That is all.\n\nFor if you don\u2019t hear, perhaps it has not (yet) been uttered.\n\nFor if neither of you hears, perhaps it will not (ever) be uttered.\n\nYet somehow it happens: \u201chospice\u201d comes to be more frequently spoken as the days pass.\n\nAnd somehow it happens that your husband, surprising himself, begins to speak of his \u201cfinal days.\u201d As in, \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nAs if shyly. On the phone very early one morning, when he calls, as he has been calling, immediately after the oncologist making rounds in the hospital has examined him.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nOn the phone, so that he is spared seeing your face. And you, his.\n\nA new shyness like the first, initial shyness. Finding some way to say I love you.\n\nFor some, an impossible statement\u2014I love you.\n\nBut your husband managed it, and you managed it, somehow: I love you.\n\nAnd now, years later, it is \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nThese words you hear over the phone distinctly, irrevocably, yet (you would claim) you have not heard them. No!\n\nBut, yes, you\u2019ve heard. Must have heard. For the walls of the room reel giddily around you, blood rushes out of your head, leaving you faint, sinking to your knees like a terrified child, stammering, \u201cWhat? What are you saying? That\u2019s ridiculous. Don\u2019t say such things! What on earth do you mean\u2014\u2018final days\u2019?\u201d\n\nYour voice rises wildly. You want to fling the cell phone from you.\n\nFor you can\u2019t bear it. You don\u2019t think so. Not knowing, at this time, the vast Sahara that lies ahead with all that you cannot bear, that nonetheless will be borne, and by you.\n\nFor always, each step of the way, you resist.\n\nIt is a steep uphill. It is natural to resist. Or, if you accept the steep climb, console yourself with the thought that it is only temporary. The plateau, the flatland to which you\u2019ve been accustomed, awaits you, both of you. You will return there. Soon.\n\nUntil a day, an hour\u2014always there is a day, an hour\u2014when you began to speak of hospice yourself.\n\nAt first, you, too, are shy, faltering. Your throat feels lacerated as if by metal filings.\n\nGradually, you learn to utter the two syllables clearly, bravely\u2014hos-pice.\n\nSoon after that, you begin to say these distinct, deliberate words: \u201cour hospice.\u201d\n\nSoon, you draw up your vows. Quaintly state to yourself, as if to God, a formal decree.\n\nIt is my hope: I will make of our hospice a honeymoon.\n\nMy vow is to make my husband as comfortable as humanly possible.\n\nTo make him happy. To make us both happy.\n\nTo fulfill whatever he wishes that is within the range of possibility.\n\nFirst: a new setting for him. NOT the Cancer Center. Our hospice will be in our home, which he loves.\n\nThe atrium flooded with morning light.\n\nThe foreshortened horizon\u2014for the house is surrounded by trees.\n\nThe flotillas of sculpted clouds.\n\nMy husband can lie on a sofa, staring at the tree line and at the sky. Comfortable on the sofa with pillows behind him and feet (in warm socks) elevated.\n\nOr, more likely, he can lie on a (rented) hospital bed, positioned in such a way that he can easily gaze out the window. And I can lie beside him, as I have done in the hospital.\n\nHolding hands. Of course, we will hold hands. His hands are still warm\u2014strong. His fingers, when squeezed, never fail to squeeze in return.\n\nAs his lips, when kissed, never fail to kiss in return.\n\nI will sleep beside my husband holding him in my arms, not strong arms, in fact, rather weak arms, which nonetheless can be made to behave as if they were strong.\n\nI will scatter seed on the redwood deck outside the window. Not ordinary seed but the more expensive \u201cwild bird seed\u201d my husband purchases.\n\nThrilling to watch the birds. Taking the time, undistracted, really watching, for once . . .\n\nAnd my husband loves music! I will bathe him in the most beautiful music through his waking hours. So long as it is not uncomfortable for him, I will lie on the bed beside him, holding him, listening with him to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cVespers.\u201d\n\n\nFalling asleep with him. Even during the day. Even with wan sunshine slanting through the window onto our faces. Head on the pillow beside his head.\n\nFrom the bookcases in the house, I will select art books, his favorite artists, books from his photography shelves\u2014Bruce Davidson, Edward Weston, Diane Arbus, Eliot Porter. I will turn the pages slowly, marvel with him.\n\nOld albums, family photographs dating back to the early nineteen-hundreds. His family, great-grandparents who emigrated from the Pale. In which he has only recently shown an interest.\n\nHis favorite foods. . . . Well, I will try!\n\nWhen he is at home, possibly his appetite will return. When I am the one to prepare his food, his appetite will return, I am sure.\n\nOf course, family will come to visit. Adult children, grandchildren. Relatives, friends. Colleagues from the university. Neighbors. Old friends from grammar school he hasn\u2019t seen in fifty years. Some surprises for him\u2014I will negotiate with the imagination of a theatre director.\n\nNot merely hospice but our hospice. Not sad but joyous, a honeymoon.\n\nWe will be happy there, in our own home. Both of us.\n\nFor both of us, the \u201cfinal days\u201d will be a honeymoon. I vow.\n\nIn fact, nothing remotely like this will happen. How could you have imagined it would!\n\nHospice, yes. Honeymoon, no.\n\n",
