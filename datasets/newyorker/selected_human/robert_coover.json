        "comment": "At first, it was great. Sure. It always is. She cuddled a frog, wishing for more, and\u2014presto! A handsome prince who doted on her. It meant the end of her marriage, of course, but her ex was something of a toad himself, who had a nasty habit of talking with his mouth full and a tongue good for nothing but licking stamps.\n\nThe prince was adorable\u2014all the girls at the bridge club, squirming with envy, said so\u2014though you could still see the effects his previous residence had had on him. He had heavy-lidded eyes and a wide mouth like a hand puppet\u2019s, his complexion was a bit off, and his loose-fitting skin was thin and clammy. His semen had a muddy taste, like the pond he came from, and his little apparatus was disappointing, but his tongue was amazing. It could reach the deepest recesses, triggering sensations she\u2019d never known before. His crown was not worn like a hat\u2014it grew out of his head like horns and sometimes got in the way\u2014but his tongue was long enough for detours and tickled other parts on the path in. It gave him not so much a lisp as a consonantal slurp, making gibberish out of his sweet nothings, but talking was never the main thing between them.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

He wasn\u2019t the cleanest of princes, but the trip was worth it. She was transported to another realm, a kind of fairy kingdom where she could have anything she desired: wealth, beauty, a spectacular wardrobe, a winning bridge hand, cream-filled chocolates with zero calories, and love whenever she wanted it, which was most of the time, even when she was doing other things, like presiding over a royal banquet or reviewing the palace guard. Just wham, bam, grand slam! Glorious! It all tended to vanish when the high wore off, but another lick and she was back again.\n\nHer suburban life began to pale by comparison, but whenever she asked the prince to transport her to his real kingdom he always took her back to the pond where she\u2019d found him. He was very happy there. He\u2019d crawl into the mud, digging in until only his protruding eyes peered out, his crown seeming to float on the surface. At home, his eyes were sometimes wide awake and popping; at other times, especially when he was eating, they sank away and almost disappeared. But at the pond he was always goggle-eyed. Now and then he would unfurl his tongue and burp and she would get into the mud with him. It wasn\u2019t the same as the hallucinatory kingdom, but it was still very nice.\n\nThe Epic Promise of Wedding Vows\n\n\nHis frequent burping blighted his regal dignity somewhat, but at the same time it was the most lovable thing about him, and when he burped he always gazed at her in an especially affectionate way. When he was still a frog, he had taken his skin off from time to time to eat it. Fortunately, the prince did not do that, though his long tongue did snap up anything that dripped or flaked off, which sometimes spoiled her appetite. About once a month, he removed his clothes and crawled up on her back and locked his skinny legs around her for several days, his long toes fondling her bosom, his padded thumbs stuck to her armpits like Velcro. She couldn\u2019t shake him off, but had to wait until whatever it was that he was doing was done. It was probably obscene, though thankfully she couldn\u2019t see it; certainly she had to launder her skirts and blouses afterward. It was difficult with the prince pasted to her back even to do her shopping or get her hair done, and she had to sit sideways on chairs and on the toilet. But the worst thing about these times was that she lost access to her high. If only she had a tongue like his!\n\nAs soon as he dismounted and before he could put his royal pantaloons on, she\u2019d get her nose right down there, drug fiend that she was, and lick her way back to the fairy kingdom. And on one such day (or night, one could never be sure in that place) when she was pinned, spread-eagled, by croquet wickets on the sunny (moonlit?) palace lawn for the pleasure of all, her euphoric self included\u2014goodness! she was popping like his eyes did\u2014he asked her in his slurping way if she was happy where she was. Oh, yes, totally! she exclaimed breathlessly, so he left her there and, if she understood him correctly, went back to the pond to crawl into the mud. Well, she missed him, just as she missed her friends at the bridge club and, truth be told, her ex as well, but she was having too much wild royal fun to think about it, or to think about anything, really, highs being like that.\n\nIt was fantastic and seemingly unending, but, alas, nothing lasts forever, least of all ecstasy, and so one day there she was at home again, lying like a deflated air bag on her filthy kitchen floor. She mopped the floor, bagged up the mess in the refrigerator, opened all the windows, and hurried back to the pond, looking for the prince. She chased burps all day and all night, but he was nowhere to be found. The weather had changed. Perhaps he was hibernating.\n\nFor a lonely year she kept up the search, at first somewhat desperately, kissing and licking any frogs she managed to catch, but eventually she resigned herself to the futility of her quest and sorrowfully abandoned it. She recalled then the prince\u2019s own sorrow and disappointment. He\u2019d thought this would be more fun, he\u2019d confessed to her once in the mud. Of course, she\u2019d been hurt by that and had pretended not to hear him, but she understood now, as she should have understood then, that he had been not an enchanted prince turned into a frog but a frog turned into a prince, and all he\u2019d wanted was to be a frog again.\n\nIn the end, she got in touch with her ex and told him that she had been hooked on a weird drug but had kicked it now, and if he\u2019d like to come back she\u2019d welcome him. He was also lonely, smoking and drinking too much, his own affairs having come to nothing, and so, gratefully, he returned, and they found a certain contentment, living more or less happily ever after, which is what \u201cnow\u201d is while one\u2019s in it. \u2666\n\n"

        "comment": "Citizen Punch, sitting under his humped back and sugarloaf hat on the lip of the little stage, his floppy legs dangling, is performing for the rowdy seaside audience below him. \u201cLife is shit,\u201d he says with his peculiar wheezle.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d they yell.\n\n\u201cPeople are better off dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me your money!\u201d he says.

They\u2019re people, and people are mostly disgusting. Sometimes he wants to hit them so hard that he can watch their heads spin. Pow! Bash! Whirr! So hard that they never recover. Ka-BLAM! No loss. They\u2019re stupid arse-kissers at best. But they do adore his arse, which he bares from time to time, taking pleasure in their adoration. \u201cIt\u2019s your best feature,\u201d the foxy Professor tells him, helping him display it. Looks like a knuckled fist, and is sometimes used as one. BOP! Sur-PRISE! He adores it, too. It\u2019s when the dummies are puckered up at his knuckled backside that he feels closest to them. Gives them his happy face to show his appreciation, make them feel good.\n\nNot everybody loves him back. There are always a few rotten barrels in every apple, as the Professor says. No problem. His people take care of them. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it!\u201d Punch tells them. \u201cTotal losers! Throw \u2019em the hell outa here!\u201d His people hate do-gooders as much as he does. \u201cWe all know life\u2019s just a joke,\u201d he squawks, \u201cbut those patsies think it has meaning! They\u2019ll never get the gag, not even when they\u2019re hit by the punch line. Lay it on! Bigly!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that, Mr. Punch?\u201d It\u2019s the Bottler. The Bottler is his fixer. Every honest man needs one. He beats on his big tin drum and tootles his pipes and works the yokels, squeezing them for cash. A genius. \u201cAre you telling jokes again?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Bottler, I\u2019m talking about the tragedy of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s a good one! You always break me up, Mr. Punch!\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me! Life\u2019s the worst deal ever, Bottler! It\u2019s an outrage! Shouldn\u2019t be allowed! But, when you get snookered and there\u2019s nobody to sue, all you can do is jump into the muck and swing your slapstick, bust a few heads, have as much fun as you can before the show closes! No one wins, but, like the Professor says, bullies last longest!\u201d\n\n\u201cA beautiful credo, Mr. Punch! You are, as everybody says, a philosopher, a visionary, and a true disbeliever!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am also a fighter, as you know. The world has done us no favors. It\u2019s been against us from the start. We gotta get tough, take it apart, eat it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cTruer words were never uttered, Mr. Punch. Listen to all your fans! They\u2019re applauding you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. They love my eloquence, my smarts. And they\u2019re so generous! The suckers have nothing, and it\u2019s like they can\u2019t give me enough. Now, go take up a collection!\u201d\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nJudy drops by with Baby. She can be a very nasty woman, Judy. From time to time, he has to belt her one. Give her credit, she always belts him back, the ugly beak-nosed bitch. They say he has a dick for a nose, but so does Judy. Gender equality! As for Baby, Punch doesn\u2019t know how he begat the little shit machine, but Judy assures him that he did. She asks him now to mind the brat while she gets her snarly hair tarted up. That\u2019s an invitation to toss squalling Baby out the window. \u201cYI-I-i-i-iii!\u201d He has the kid on a string, hauls her back up, throws her out the window again. Listen to her scream! He loves it! The crowd loves it!\n\nJudy doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s gone to yell at the authorities about him, and now the scowling Doctor is standing where she was. The Doctor tells Punch that he belongs in the madhouse. He is mentally unbalanced. To prove it, the Doctor wraps his flabby arms around a slapstick as big as he is and\u2014pow!\u2014knocks Punch head over heels into the wings. Punch springs back, snatches the slapstick, and\u2014\u201cUnbalanced, my ass, baldy!\u201d he yelps\u2014smacks the Doctor with it. The Doctor\u2019s an old guy; it\u2019s easy. Laughing, Punch whacks him again. And again. Once more. He\u2019s dead.\n\nA brass-buttoned, red-nosed Constable turns up while he\u2019s still pummeling the dead Doctor and tells Punch that he\u2019s under arrest. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the law,\u201d he says. What a laugh!\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what else gets broken,\u201d Punch cackles gleefully and lays into the Bobby with his stick. Ka-whack! WHAM! The Bobby\u2019s helmet head cracks open, but he picks himself up and hits Punch with a subpoena. Punch hits him with a subpoena. Biff! Boff! He\u2019s got the Bobby on the ropes! The crowd\u2019s loving it! They shout out encouragement, and Punch pauses to take a bow. The broken-headed Bobby, on his dangling feet, swings his massive cudgel with both arms. The crowd tries to warn Punch, but too late\u2014thwock! Punch is down. The Constable safety-pins Punch\u2019s floppy hands to his pants and hauls him off to stand trial.\n\nThe Judge in his white wig calls for testimony from the victims. Pretty Polly says that Punch raped her. Joey the Clown says the same, and so does Crocodile.\n\n\u201cGuilty!\u201d the Judge announces gravely, bringing his gavel down. \u201cCitizen Punch must hang for his diabolical crimes!\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheers at that. What? Then, when Punch asks the court for mercy, the Judge responds by rapping Punch\u2019s head with his gavel\u2014knock! knock! The crowd on the beach whoops it up. The traitors! After all he\u2019s done for them! It\u2019s not fair!\n\nAnd now here comes the hooded Hangman to carry out the Judge\u2019s sentence! Not a nice fellow. The crowd agrees. No one loves a hangman. The Hangman throws the noose over Punch\u2019s head, but he ducks away. \u201cIt\u2019s too small!\u201d Punch cries out in his kazoo-like voice, as the noose bounces off him.\n\n\n\u201cIt fits all customers,\u201d the Hangman insists.\n\n\u201cNo, look, it\u2019s too small even for you!\u201d Punch squawks.\n\nThe Hangman shows Punch that he\u2019s wrong by dropping the noose over his own head, and Punch kicks him off the stage, hanging the Hangman! Punch has the howling crowd once more in the palm of his hand. But that hand is pinned to his britches.\n\nThe Judge himself comes to complete the grim ceremony. Judy\u2019s there as a witness, along with Joey the Clown, loose-jointed old Jim Crow, Toby the Dog, loudmouth Mr. Scaramouche, and the Bobby, looking smug under his yawning helmet.\n\nWhile the Judge is looping the noose over Punch\u2019s head, his white wig falls off: It\u2019s the Devil himself! Grinning like a no-see-no-hear monkey! The Devil is greeted by the fickle crowd below with friendly boos and laughter. He smiles his wicked smile and says, \u201cHello, Mr. Punch. And goodbye, Mr. Punch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, Your Honor! I don\u2019t care if you hang me\u2014life\u2019s nothing more than a dirty joke, good riddance\u2014but I have to pray to my Maker, and I can\u2019t do that with my hands pinned to my arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when have you become religious, Mr. Punch?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the day I first saw you, Your Honor, a model for all honest thieves. The Almighty props me up, fingers me where it feels good, I\u2019d be limp as a rag without him, but you\u2019re the one who fondles my black heart!\u201d\n\nThe Devil, flattered, relents. \u201cNo tricks now, Mr. Punch!\u201d\n\nPunch, freed, grabs up a slapstick and wallops him with it. The Devil laughs off the blow and fights back with fire and brimstone. Punch turns his stick into a cricket bat and swats the stinking brimstone back at the Devil. The Devil\u2019s judicial robes catch fire, and he shrinks away inside them, shrieking obscenities.\n\nPunch surveys the bleating lowlifes ringed around him on the beach, cheering, laughing, waiting for the next act, but their whoops sound fake, their howls of laughter hollow. Some are even turning away, as if to say they\u2019ve seen it all before. Sad. Punch is disillusioned. He works his ass off, beating up on everybody, sending them all to Hell or worse, and no one shows him the least appreciation. What\u2019s it all for?\n\nThe Professor doesn\u2019t know but tells him that he can\u2019t quit. \u201cLife\u2019s a scam,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing to do, except make shit up and carry on. See how rich you can get, who you can fuck over. Nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nPunch can feel the Professor getting into his head, tickling the doubts away. Grinning again his hawkish grin, he picks up his slapstick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it!\u201d the Bottler says, working the crowds at his feet. \u201cUh-oh! Look out, Mr. Punch! Ha ha! Here comes Judy!\u201d\n\n"

        "post_title": "Going for a Beer",
        "comment": "He finds himself sitting in the neighborhood bar drinking a beer at about the same time that he began to think about going there for one. In fact, he has finished it. Perhaps he\u2019ll have a second one, he thinks, as he downs it and asks for a third. There is a young woman sitting not far from him who is not exactly good-looking but good-looking enough, and probably good in bed, as indeed she is. Did he finish his beer? Can\u2019t remember. What really matters is: Did he enjoy his orgasm? Or even have one? This he is wondering on his way home through the foggy night streets from the young woman\u2019s apartment. Which was full of Kewpie dolls, the sort won at carnivals, and they made a date, as he recalls, to go to one. Where she wins another\u2014she has a knack for it. Whereupon they\u2019re in her apartment again, taking their clothes off, she excitedly cuddling her new doll in a bed heaped with them. He can\u2019t remember when he last slept, and he\u2019s no longer sure, as he staggers through the night streets, still foggy, where his own apartment is, his orgasm, if he had one, already fading from memory. Maybe he should take her back to the carnival, he thinks, where she wins another Kewpie doll (this is at least their second date, maybe their fourth), and this time they go for a romantic nightcap at the bar where they first met. Where a brawny dude starts hassling her. He intervenes and she turns up at his hospital bed, bringing him one of her Kewpie dolls to keep him company. Which is her way of expressing the bond between them, or so he supposes, as he leaves the hospital on crutches, uncertain what part of town he is in. Or what part of the year. He decides that it\u2019s time to call the affair off\u2014she\u2019s driving him crazy\u2014but then the brawny dude turns up at their wedding and apologizes for the pounding he gave him. He didn\u2019t realize, he says, how serious they were. The guy\u2019s wedding present is a gift certificate for two free drinks at the bar where they met and a pair of white satin ribbons for his crutches. During the ceremony, they both carry Kewpie dolls that probably have some barely hidden significance, and indeed do. The child she bears him, his or another\u2019s, reminds him, as if he needed reminding, that time is fast moving on. He has responsibilities now and he decides to check whether he still has the job that he had when he first met her. He does. His absence, if he has been absent, is not remarked on, but he is not congratulated on his marriage, either, no doubt because\u2014it comes back to him now\u2014before he met his wife he was engaged to one of his colleagues and their co-workers had already thrown them an engagement party, so they must resent the money they spent on gifts. It\u2019s embarrassing and the atmosphere is somewhat hostile, but he has a child in kindergarten and another on the way, so what can he do? Well, he still hasn\u2019t cashed in the gift certificate, so, for one thing, what the hell, he can go for a beer, two, in fact, and he can afford a third. There\u2019s a young woman sitting near him who looks like she\u2019s probably good in bed, but she\u2019s not his wife and he has no desire to commit adultery, or so he tells himself, as he sits on the edge of her bed with his pants around his ankles. Is he taking them off or putting them on? He\u2019s not sure, but now he pulls them on and limps home, having left his beribboned crutches somewhere. On arrival, he finds all the Kewpie dolls, which were put on a shelf when the babies started coming, now scattered about the apartment, beheaded and with their limbs amputated. One of the babies is crying, so, while he warms up a bottle of milk on the stove, he goes into its room to give it a pacifier and discovers a note from his wife pinned to its pajamas, which says that she has gone off to the hospital to have another baby and she\u2019d better not find him here when she gets back, because if she does she\u2019ll kill him. He believes her, so he\u2019s soon out on the streets again, wondering if he ever gave that bottle to the baby, or if it\u2019s still boiling away on the stove. He passes the old neighborhood bar and is tempted but decides that he has had enough trouble for one lifetime and is about to walk on when he is stopped by that hulk who beat him up and who now gives him a cigar because he\u2019s just become a father and drags him into the bar for a celebratory drink, or, rather, several, he has lost count. The celebrations are already over, however, and the new father, who has married the same woman who threw him out, is crying in his beer about the miseries of married life and congratulating him on being well out of it, a lucky man. But he doesn\u2019t feel lucky, especially when he sees a young woman sitting near them who looks like she\u2019s probably good in bed and decides to suggest that they go to her place, but too late\u2014she\u2019s already out the door with the guy who beat him up and stole his wife. So he has another beer, wondering where he\u2019s supposed to live now, and realizing\u2014it\u2019s the bartender who so remarks while offering him another on the house\u2014that life is short and brutal and before he knows it he\u2019ll be dead. He\u2019s right. After a few more beers and orgasms, some vaguely remembered, most not, one of his sons, now a racecar driver and the president of the company he used to work for, comes to visit him on his deathbed and, apologizing for arriving so late (I went for a beer, Dad, things happened), says he\u2019s going to miss him but it\u2019s probably for the best. For the best what? he asks, but his son is gone, if he was ever there in the first place. Well . . . you know . . . life, he says to the nurse who has come to pull the sheet over his face and wheel him away. \u2666\n\n"

        "comment": "\u201cHey, sweetheart, nice patoot,\u201d says the sad-eyed taxi-driver sitting at the all-night-diner counter, a doughnut wallowing in his unshaven jowls. The waitress glares at him. She is fed up with being ogled, or else stared at in disgust, whenever she bends over to pick up a dishrag. \u201cIf a goat wandered in, they\u2019d ogle the goat and say the same stupid things,\u201d she complains to the old bag lady near the cash register, to whom she has offered a free bowl of hot soup. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it. I wish nobody could ever look at me.\u201d The bag lady turns out to be a fairy godmother in disguise, and, in thanks for the soup, she raises her spoon like a wand and grants the waitress her wish, so that when she tries to hand the taxi-driver his check, his head swivels sharply on his bovine neck. Is he refusing it? The waitress moves over into his line of sight and his head pops the other way. \u201cJesus, that hurt,\u201d he whimpers. She glances over at the bag lady, but the sweet old thing has vanished.\n\nPeople turn away from then on\u2014they just can\u2019t stop themselves. Whisk, whisk, whisk, go their heads as she passes by. Sometimes they make little yipping sounds, which adds to her amusement. She likes to stroll through busy department stores, city parks, and railway stations at rush hour, watching the heads snap away in choral waves. Sometimes, just for fun, she takes her clothes off, remembering her thrill as a child undressing in front of her bedroom window, but then, catching sight of her reflection in a shopwindow (the mannequins stare icily, straight at her), she sees what a silly fat fool she is and stops that.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

So, jobless, she heads to a bar to get as drunk as she can on her cheapskate boss\u2019s payoff, wishing she could find someone to tell her troubles to who wouldn\u2019t turn away. Outside the bar, she comes upon a guy who does keep looking at her, a beardy panhandler, slumped against the building clutching a brown paper bag and a tin cup. Has the spell worn off? No, she guesses it at once: he is blind. She\u2019s not sure, but maybe she has just used up a second wish, because, glancing over her shoulder, she sees the backside of the old bag lady, toddling away around a corner.\n\nHow a Notorious D.E.A. Informant Busted Criminals\n\n\nShe takes the blind beggar home with her, as if he were something she\u2019d won in a raffle, feeds and showers him, and they have a good time for a few hours. \u201cAmple\u201d is his favorable judgment after doing the Braille thing. But then she has to think about what happens next. She has no job now and two mouths to feed, two bodies to clothe and care for. His tin cup was empty, the bottle in his brown paper bag as well\u2014his own career, like hers, has been going nowhere. Maybe that old homeless lady could help if she could find her. She may have used up two wishes already and, if so, has essentially wasted them both, but, if the legends are true, she still has a third. If she finds the bag lady, she\u2019ll have to be careful, given the old dear\u2019s wicked sense of humor. Wishing to live forever, for example, might be a nightmarishly bad choice. No need to wish for beauty if no one can see her, and perfect health\u2019s no good if she\u2019s condemned to poverty. So she decides to wish for fabulous wealth, and to keep on repeating it, so as not to blurt out something stupid and end up like that couple who wished their noses into sausages.\n\nShe checks the streets near the diner where she first saw her, wishing her money wish over and over, but the bag lady is nowhere to be seen. Finally, she gives up and heads instead to a liquor store to use up her last couple of bills in the best way possible, passing a bank where, by chance, a robbery is taking place. The heads of the thieves snap aside so violently when they rush out of the bank door toward her that they stumble and drop what they\u2019re carrying, spilling it out on the street. There are sirens, the thieves are on the run, and the money\u2019s there for the taking, piles of it. She wouldn\u2019t even have to waste a wish. Then she realizes that, on the contrary, she has just used up her last one. Somewhere, the old bird is laughing again. If the waitress grabs up the stolen loot, she\u2019ll be on everybody\u2019s most-wanted list, but if she walks away the granting of her final wish will be recklessly wasted. She looks up and sees that the security cameras have snapped away from her and hang by their wires. A handful of the scattered bills would never be missed, but a handful is not what she wished for; if she pinched a little she might be in more trouble than if she took it all.\n\nA couple of large grimy shopping bags come floating past on a sudden breeze, dancing to the tune of the wailing sirens. The bag lady is still taking care of her. Or teasing her. The waitress fills them, but there\u2019s money left over. Her skirt and shirt and underclothes can all be tied into bags, so she takes them off, knots them, and loads them up, too. There\u2019s more now than she can drag home on her own, but when she tries to hail a taxi the drivers can\u2019t see her, for all there is to see. Luckily, she finds a guy snoozing in his parked cab. Did she wish for that? Looks like he might be the same unshaven yo-yo who was in the diner the night it all began. She heaves the bags of money into the back seat, crawls in beside them, and gives the driver, who wakes with a snort, her address. He tries to see what she has brought in with her, but his head keeps bouncing away. \u201cOh, oh,\u201d he grunts, reaching for the door. \u201cWait!\u201d she says, and drops some big bills onto the seat beside him. It\u2019s probably more raw cash than he\u2019s ever seen before. With an appreciative whistle, he pulls the door shut and asks for that address again. It\u2019s not easy getting there. Other drivers\u2019 heads, glancing their way, snap to the side, and up and down the street there are accidents. Her guy is ducking, dodging, cursing. \u201cHey, it\u2019s a dangerous world,\u201d she says, squatting down behind the front seat to make it easier for him, and he laughs sourly at that.\n\nAt home, she\u2019ll wrestle the bags in somehow, then call up for pizza delivery and a case or two from the liquor store, put some music on, and she and the blind beggar will dance the night away. It won\u2019t exactly be happily ever after, but the bag lady never promised her that. \u2666\n\n"

        "post_title": "The Hanging of the Schoolmarm",
        "comment": "The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself. As she is preparing to deal the cards, one of the men demands that she cut the fuckin\u2019 deck, and she shoots him from her lap. \u201cSorry, but I simply cannot allow . . .\u201d\n\nThe others tip their crumpled hats. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, you just go ahead and deal.\u201d\n\nThe men of the town find the schoolmarm difficult but are awed by her refined and lofty character, and generally do what she tells them to do. The sheriff likes to say that she\u2019s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot\u2014in fact, all the time\u2014but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn\u2019t go together with the schoolmarm. It\u2019s like salting your coffee, to put it politely.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nAfter winning the saloon in the poker hand, the schoolmarm has the deceased removed and turns the card tables into school desks. The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there\u2019s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it\u2019s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.\n\nThe men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two \u201ct\u201ds in \u201cspitting,\u201d for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign\u2019s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it\u2019s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.\n\nThe schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They\u2019ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they\u2019ve come home again.\n\nThe schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm\u2019s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\n\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\n\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\n\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\n\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\n\n\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\n\n\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry. I suppose it is. Give me a rock to hold.\u201d \u2666\n\n"

        "post_title": "The Boss",
        "comment": "The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn\u2019t here. No one is. It\u2019s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley\u2019s deserted.\n\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you\u2019re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked\u2014perhaps that\u2019s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you\u2019re buried in? He doesn\u2019t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don\u2019t think about it.\n\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There\u2019s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss\u2019s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he\u2019s alive, when not much else does.\n\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It\u2019s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn\u2019t belong. Which wouldn\u2019t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\n\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\n\nI don\u2019t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\n\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She\u2019s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\n\nRachel Maddow talks with David Remnick\n\n\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it\u2019s a kind of dance. She asks if he\u2019s making fun of her. He says he doesn\u2019t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn\u2019t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\n\nIt won\u2019t do any good, she says, reading him.\n\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\n\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp\u2019s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it\u2019s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven\u2019t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\n\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it\u2019s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\n\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it\u2019s too late.\n\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\n\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn\u2019t understand a fucking thing.\n\n"
