        "comment": "That spring the premier implemented a series of daring protocols. He was a thin man, sharp dresser. After lunch you\u2019d see him leaving a certain outdoor caf\u00e9 erratically, in a party spirit, knocking back the last drops from an elongated champagne flute he\u2019d leave on the low wall by the lane for the waiter to scurry over and collect.\n\nWith him would go three hulking curved backs, and sometimes a shaved head on a thick neck would turn, accusing any diners whose eyes still followed the premier. About these thick-necks hung a suggestion of guns concealed beneath expensive jackets worn casually, as if they\u2019d been born thick-necked babies and issued tiny expensive Italian shoes and immediately started chewing gum and being suspicious of the other babies in the nursery while waiting for the premier to come and find them so that the truly useful part of their lives could begin.\n\nThe premier\u2019s ethos had left its mark even on the river, which ran now through a changed city where the warmth formerly felt among the people seemed a quaint relic of some earlier, lethargic era during which little brusque progress had been made. Occasionally, the river would cough up a body, having first imbued it with a reptilian cast that made the person the reptile used to be seem retrospectively guilty.\n\nA person wanted to stay clear of it, all of it. Sons were swept into the militia or trucked to a rumored labor camp out beyond the slaughterhouse. Daughters, too, were vanishing\u2014seen slithering into cars, ruined, addicted, smirking.\n\nDistinction of any kind could land one (one\u2019s child, one\u2019s spouse, even one\u2019s horse\u2014a horse was taken for the sins of its owner) in the river. The thing to do was develop an interest in the flower boxes on one\u2019s balcony or keep a record of the stars one saw at night and lose oneself entirely in such things.\n\nThen it was fall and a red car burst into the caf\u00e9, throwing tables around. It seemed to want the premier and it left as soon as it had got him, bucking a few unlucky diners off its back. The thick-necks were now melded into one entity, a woven placemat improbably atop it. The premier was just a slim dead thing holding a fork, still impeccably dressed.\n\nThe driver sped away, carrying the burden, we supposed, of the way the screaming and crunching had felt to him. He must be forever changed, we thought, entire fields of joy no longer his, every lovely thing tainted. But who could say? Maybe he walked around feeling like a hero. We had no idea. He and his red car had just vanished into the afternoon dust.\n\nWithin days a man came forward to take credit for killing the premier. This was news to the man who\u2019d actually done it. Bottles of wine began appearing in front of the false killer\u2019s apartment door, and his stairway became difficult to navigate for all the bouquets. Regarding the impostor, the real killer tried to be at peace. Which was difficult, given all the glory the false killer was getting. The real killer started having panic attacks and a recurring nightmare in which one of the unlucky diners, a young woman, smiled at him with welcoming curiosity, as she had on the day, as if, instead of killing her, he were bringing a surprise dessert to her table.\n\nThen came a strange twist in our national saga.\n\nThe false killer, rescuer of the republic, was assassinated by a cowardly group of reactionaries loyal to the former premier, who detonated a bomb just as the great national hero stepped out one morning to collect his wine and flowers.\n\nThe new premier quickly announced that the reactionaries were to be hanged without a trial in the public square. The former premier had always had his enemies killed behind closed doors, brutally, for the terror of it, with crowbars and mallets, requiring these occasions to be filmed. A rushed public hanging therefore seemed almost moderate by comparison.\n\nBut a week before the execution, there came a confused, confusing announcement: the false killer was not, as it turned out, dead after all, just badly wounded, \u201clikely to recover,\u201d both legs and part of one arm blown off.\n\nThe main newspaper, emboldened by the relative liberality of the new regime, intoned jocularly that a person was either dead or not. Correct? One did not \u201crecover\u201d from death, did one? Yes, \u201cquite a recovery,\u201d hectored the next largest paper, trying to get in on the fun. Who had decided to lie to the people? And why? Had we not had enough of this obscurantist nonsense?\n\nThe false killer now became, to the chagrin of the real killer, an even greater national hero. Photos of him being cared for by his beautiful but not too beautiful fianc\u00e9e began to appear in the newspapers, which had the effect of causing the people to feel that merely hanging the reactionaries was somehow not enough.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, a mob stormed the jail, and the jailers (some of them, enough of them) stepped aside, and the reactionaries were dragged off to the abandoned sports stadium, where things worse than hanging were done to them, and then their mutilated corpses were burned in a pit, into which the men who had mutilated the corpses took turns jovially urinating, an act many of them, including my brother, would come to regret.\n\nBecause over the next week a troubling rumor was confirmed by the main newspaper: the reactionaries who\u2019d planted the bomb that had maimed the false killer had not been reactionaries after all but a group of grieving, justice-seeking relatives of the unlucky diners.\n\nCertain overzealous supporters of the new premier had (apparently, regrettably) used various forms of mild physical persuasion to elicit false confessions from the loved ones of the unlucky diners, confessions that would serve, once obtained, they felt, to confirm the new premier\u2019s position that, in order for him to continue his important work of restoring order, all must remain vigilant to the possibility that reactionary elements loyal to the former premier not only still existed but were actively plotting a devious return to power.\n\nThe newspapers embarked on a period of hand-wringing regarding the new premier\u2019s adoption of his predecessor\u2019s oppressive habits, a hand-wringing that ceased only when the offices of the three leading newspapers were simultaneously firebombed.\n\nThe editors of these papers bravely continued, in hastily printed broadsheets, to claim that violence only begat further violence and that the nation was in an inexplicable downward spiral, the only way out of which was a return to love and fellow-feeling. Then the bodies of these editors were found floating in the river, beheaded, and the bodies of the fathers of these editors were discovered in the main square, a copy of each son\u2019s paper\u2019s masthead heavy-stapled into the applicable torso.\n\nWe all experienced a palpable increase in our fear of, and respect for, the new premier and hastily reverted to our previous flinching, cautious way of living.\n\nEvery Saturday now he held court in the caf\u00e9 in which the old premier had died, to demonstrate how utterly unafraid he was. He even took questions, though his guards (he had nine) might sometimes jokingly point a machine gun at a citizen whose question seemed insufficiently patriotic.\n\nOne Saturday morning, the man who had actually killed the former premier went to his dead uncle\u2019s garage, where he\u2019d hidden the red car, started it up, then sat behind the wheel, thinking. Once already, in the name of goodness, he\u2019d sullied himself with murder. Shouldn\u2019t he at least try to kill this new, even more evil, premier? Otherwise, what had it all been about?\n\nKilling the new premier would entail killing another set of unlucky diners. For him: more panic attacks, fresh nightmares. This time, if he succeeded, he would at least take some credit. Good God, yes, he would: no more silent suffering in anonymity. Afterward, he would climb up on the hood of his red car and, addressing the people, propose a new movement that would eschew violence and rule by justice and gentleness forever. Also firmness, of course. A merciful firmness the people would instantly respect.\n\nOr he could forget the whole thing, go back to being the man he\u2019d been before the first killing: a frightened, passive nobody.\n\nThis thought made him sicker than the thought of another round of screaming and crunching.\n\nHe leaped out of the still running red car, threw the garage door open, and, feeling alive and decisive, stood blinking in the morning sunlight, readying himself for his task. \u2666\n\n",

        "post_title": "I Can Speak!\u2122",
        "comment": "Mrs. Ruth Faniglia\n210 Lester Street\nRochester, N.Y. 14623\n\nDear Mrs. Faniglia,\n\nWe were very sorry to receive your letter of 23 Feb., which accompanied the i can speak!\u2122 you returned, much to our disappointment. We here at KidLuv believe that the i can speak!\u2122 is an innovative and essential educational tool that, used with proper parental guidance, offers a rare early-development opportunity for babies and toddlers alike. And so I thought I would take some of my personal time (I am on lunch) and try to address the questions you raised in your letter, which is here in front of me on my (cluttered!) desk.\n\nFirst, may I be so bold as to suggest that your disappointment may stem from your own, perhaps unreasonable, expectations? Because in your letter, what you indicated, when I read it, was that you think and/or thought that somehow the product can read your baby\u2019s mind? Our product cannot read your baby\u2019s mind, Mrs. Faniglia. No one can read a baby\u2019s mind, at least not yet. Although believe me, we are probably working on it! All the i can speak!\u2122 can do, however, is respond to aural patterns in a way that makes baby seem older. Say baby sees a peach. If you or Mr. Faniglia (I hope I do not presume) were to loudly say something like \u201cWhat a delicious peach!\u201d the i can speak!\u2122, hearing this, through that little slotted hole near the neck, would respond by saying something like \u201ci like peach.\u201d Or \u201ci want peach.\u201d Or, if you had chosen the ICS2000 (you chose the ICS1900, which is fine, perfectly good for most babies), the i can speak!\u2122 might even respond by saying something like \u201cfruit, isn\u2019t that one of the major food groups?\u201d Which would be pretty good, for a six-month-old like Derek, your son, don\u2019t you think?\n\nBut here I must reiterate: That would not in reality be Derek speaking. Derek would not in reality know that a peach is fruit, or that fruit is a major food group. The i can speak!\u2122 knows, however, and, from its position on Derek\u2019s face, it will give the illusion that Derek knows, by giving the illusion that Derek is speaking out of the twin moving SimuLips. But that is it. That is all we claim.\n\nFurthermore, in your letter, Mrs. Faniglia, you state that the i can speak!\u2122 \u201cmask\u201d (your terminology) takes on a \u201cstressed-out look when talking that is not what a real baby\u2019s talking face appears like but is more like some nervous middle-aged woman.\u201d Well, maybe that is so, but, with all due respect, you try it! You try making a latex face look and talk and move like the real face of an actual live baby! Inside are over 5000 separate circuits and 390 moving parts. And as far as looking like a middle-aged woman, we beg to differ: we do not feel that a middle-aged stressed-out woman has (1) no hair on head and (2) chubby cheeks and (3) fine downy facial hair. The ICS1900 unit is definitely the face of a baby, Mrs. Faniglia. We took over twenty-five hundred photos of different babies and using a computer combined them to make this face, this face we call Male Composite 37 or, affectionately, Little Roger. But what you possibly seem to be unhappy about is that Little Roger\u2019s face is not Derek\u2019s face? To be frank, Mrs. Faniglia, many of you, our customers, have found it disconcerting that their baby looks different with the i can speak!\u2122 on. Which we find so surprising. Did you, we often wonder, not look at the cover of the box? On that cover the ICS1900 is very plainly shown, situated on a sort of rack, looking face-wise like Little Roger, albeit Little Roger is a bit crumpled and has a forehead furrow of sorts.\n\nBut this is why we came up with the ICS2100. With the ICS2100, your baby looks just like your baby. And, because we do not want anyone to be unhappy with us, we would like to give you a complimentary ICS2100 upgrade! We would like to come to your house on Lester Street and make a personalized plaster cast of Derek\u2019s real, actual face! And soon, via FedEx, here will come Derek\u2019s face in a box, and when you slip that ICS2100 over Derek\u2019s head and Velcro the Velcro, he will look so very much like himself! Plus we have another free surprise, which is that, while at your house, we will tape his actual voice and use it to make our phrases, the phrases Derek will subsequently say. So not only will he look like himself, he will sound like himself, as he crawls around your house appearing to speak!\n\n\u201cI Can Speak\u2122\u201d by George Saunders\nCartoon by Christopher Weyant, January 19, 2015\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\n\nOpen cartoon gallery\nPlus we will throw in several other personalizing options. Say you call Derek \u201cLovemeister.\u201d (I am using this example from my own personal home, as my wife, Ann, and I call our son Billy \u201cLovemeister,\u201d because he is so sweet.) With the ICS2100, you might choose to have Derek say, upon crawling into a room, \u201chere comes the lovemeister!\u201d or \u201cstop talking dirty, the lovemeister has arrived!\u201d How we do this is, laser beams coming out of the earlobes, which sense the doorframe. So the i can speak!\u2122 knows it has just entered a room, from its position on Derek\u2019s head! And also you will have over one hundred Discretionary Phrases to more highly personalize Derek. For instance, you might choose to have him say, on his birthday, \u201cmommy and daddy, remember that time you conceived me in aruba?\u201d Although probably you did not in fact conceive Derek in Aruba. That we do not know. (Our research is not that extensive!) Or say your dog comes up and gives Derek a lick? You could make Derek say (if your dog\u2019s name is Queenie), \u201cqueenie, give it a rest!\u201d Which, you know what? It makes you love him more. Because suddenly he is articulate. Suddenly he is not just sitting there going glub glub glub while examining a piece of his own feces on his own thumb, which is something we recently found Billy doing! Sometimes we have felt that our childless friends think badly of us for having a kid who just goes glub glub glub in the corner while looking at his feces on his thumb. But now when childless friends are over, what we have found, my wife, Ann, and I, is that it\u2019s great to have your kid say something witty and self-possessed years before he or she would actually in reality be able to say something witty or self-possessed. The bottom line is that it\u2019s just fun when you and your childless friends are playing cards, and your baby suddenly blurts out (in his very own probable future voice), \u201cit is likely that we still don\u2019t fully understand the import of all of einstein\u2019s findings!\u201d\n\n\nHere I must admit that we have several times seen a sort of softening in the eyes of our resolute childless friends, as if they, too, would suddenly like to have a baby.\n\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\n\n\nAnd as far as Derek flinching whenever that voice issues forth from him? When that speaker near his mouth sort of buzzes his lips? May I say this is not unusual? What I suggest? Try putting the ICS on Derek for a short time at first, maybe ten minutes a day, then gradually building up his Wearing Time. That is what we did. And it worked super. Now Billy wears his even while sleeping. In fact, if we forget to put it back on after his bath, he pitches a fit. Kind of begs for it! He starts to say, you know, \u201cMak! Mak!\u201d Which we think is his word for mask. And when we put the mask on and Velcro the Velcro, he says, or rather it says, \u201cguten morgen, papa!\u201d because we are trying to teach him German, and have installed the German Learning module in our ICS2100. Or for example, if his pants are not yet on, he\u2019ll say, \u201chow about slapping on my rompers so i can get on with my day!\u201d (I wrote that one. )\n\nMy point is, with the ICS2100 Billy is much, much cleverer than he ever was with the ICS1900. He has recently learned, for example, that if he spills a little milk on his chin, his SimuLips will issue a moo sound. Which he really seems to get a kick out of! I\u2019ll be in the living room doing a little evening paperwork and from the kitchen I\u2019ll hear, you know, \u201cmoo! moo! moo!\u201d And I\u2019ll rush in, and there\u2019ll be this sort of lake of milk on the floor. And there\u2019ll be Billy, pouring milk on his chin until I yank the milk away, at which point he bellows, \u201cdon\u2019t fence me in.\u201d (Ann\u2019s contribution\u2014she was raised in Wyoming!)\n\nI, for one, Mrs. Faniglia, do not believe that any baby wants to sit around all day going glub glub glub. My feeling is that a baby, sitting in its diaper, looking around at the world, thinks to itself, albeit in some crude nonverbal way, What the heck is wrong with me, why am I the only one going glub glub glub while all these other folks are talking in whole complete sentences? And hence, possibly, lifelong psychological damage may result. Now, am I saying that your Derek runs the risk of feeling bad about himself as a grownup because as a baby he felt he didn\u2019t know how to talk right? No, it is not for me to say that, Mrs. Faniglia, I am only in Sales. But I will say that I am certainly not taking any chances with our Billy. My belief is that when Billy hears a competent, intelligent voice issuing from the area near his mouth, he feels excellent about himself. And I feel excellent about him. Not that I didn\u2019t feel excellent about him before. But now we can actually have a sort of conversation! And also\u2014and most importantly\u2014when that voice issues from his SimuLips he learns something invaluable; namely, that when he finally does begin speaking, he will be speaking via using his mouth.\n\nNow, Mrs. Faniglia, you may be thinking, Hold on a sec, of course this guy loves his i can speak!\u2122 He probably gets his for free! But not so, Mrs. Faniglia, I get mine for two grand, just like you. We get no discounts, so much in demand is the i can speak!\u2122, and in addition we are strongly encouraged by our management to purchase and use the i can speak!\u2122 at home, on our own kids. (Or even, in one case, on an elderly senile mom! Suffice it to say that, though she looks sort of funny with the Little Roger head on her somewhat frail frame, the family takes great comfort in hearing all the witty things she has to say. Just like her old self!) Not that I wouldn\u2019t use it otherwise. Believe me, I would. Since we upgraded to the ICS2100, things have been great, Billy looks almost identical to himself, and is not nearly so, you know, boring as before, when we had the ICS1900, which (frankly) says some rather predictable things, which I expect is partly why you were so unhappy with it, Mrs. Faniglia, you seem like a very intelligent woman. When people come over now, sometimes we just gather around Billy and wait for his next howler, and last weekend my supervisor, Mr. Ted Ames, stopped by (a super guy, he has really given me support, please let him know if you\u2019ve found this letter at all helpful) and boy did we all crack up laughing when Billy began rubbing his face very rapidly across the carpet in order to make his ICS2100 shout, \u201cfriction is a common and useful source of heat!\u201d\n\nMrs. Faniglia, it is nearing the end of my lunch, and so I must wrap this up, but I hope I have been of service. On a personal note, I did not have the greatest of pasts when I came here, having been in a few scrapes and even rehab situations, but now, wow, the commissions roll in, and I have made a nice life for me and Ann and Billy. Not that the possible loss of my commission is the reason for my concern. Please do not think so. While it is true that, if you decline my upgrade offer and persist in your desire to return your ICS1900, my commission must be refunded, by me, to Mr. Ames, it is no big deal, I have certainly refunded commissions to Mr. Ames before, especially lately. I don\u2019t quite know what I\u2019m doing wrong. But that is not your concern, Mrs. Faniglia. Your concern is Derek. My real reason for writing this letter, on my lunch break, is that, hard as we all work at KidLuv to provide innovative and essential development tools for families like yours, Mrs. Faniglia, it is always sort of a heartbreak when our products are misapprehended. Please do accept our offer of a free ICS2100 upgrade. We at KidLuv really love what kids are, Mrs. Faniglia, which is why we want them to become something better as soon as possible! Baby\u2019s early years are so precious, and must not be wasted, as we are finding out, as our Billy grows and grows, learning new skills every day.\n\nSincerely yours,\nRick Sminks\nProduct Service Representative\nKidLuv, Inc. \u2666\n\n",
