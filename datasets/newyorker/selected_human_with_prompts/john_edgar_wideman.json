        "comment": "George Floyd is dead while I write this story. If I had written these words a little more than a year ago, G.F. alive. In a year, he will not be alive, whether I write or don\u2019t write this story about him. Except perhaps alive in the way stories live, or alive as people say people are alive in stories. People saying that as if they do not understand: dead once, dead forever. As if they don\u2019t know that once is all the time a person ever gets to be alive. As if they don\u2019t know that G.F. doesn\u2019t hear, doesn\u2019t desire mourning, clamor, and cries. As if they do not comprehend that their millions of bodies piled up or kneeling in prayer or prostrate in the street next to G.F. all weigh less than this sheet of paper on which I scribble, and that the commotion, agitation, exercise of their millions upon millions of hearts and minds will not summon a single breath of air when G.F. needs it.\n\nI will not pretend to bring G.F. to life. Nor pretend to bring life to him. G.F. gone for good. Won\u2019t return. No place for G.F. except the past. And the past is not even past, a wise man once declared. Same abyss behind and in front of us is what the wisecracker writer signifying, I believe, and, if I truly believe what he believed, where would I situate G.F. if presented with an opportunity to put him somewhere alive? Not here. Not here in this story where I know better.\n\nBetter to forget G.F. Better to let go, or simply leave G.F. alone, thank you, than attempt to invent the point of view of a person not here, not where I am, a person who somehow possesses the power to see G.F. breathing, moving around, to hear G.F.\u2019s thoughts. A person also able to observe me here, myself performing this grief, this terror and anger, this attempt to console myself and define and control and locate myself, establish myself as one who is offering a story about G.F., a true story confirming my suffering, my connection to him, a story about who he is, who I am, a story about myself, as if I am not here where I am and he is not where he is. As if the two of us not permanently separate as life from death. As dreams from objects dreamed.\n\nBetter to acknowledge impenetrable darkness surrounding G.F. and me, black darkness blinding me when I pretend I can speak with the authority of a being I imagine whose perspective absolutely reliable. Why write as if I can access the power such an angelic being might possess. As if I am able to employ that power to see, to enter G.F. Power to convince myself, or anybody who might be paying attention or reading or simply curious, that my feelings for G.F., my performance, my outrage, my rituals of claiming and disclaiming an unbreakable relationship to him are authentic. Serve some useful purpose. That my eyes, words reliable, convincing as words, eyes of that imaginary observer I proposed a few sentences ago. Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory. A kind of presumption. Wishful thinking at best. Guilt and avoidance at worst. Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven. Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I\u2019m pretending I am.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee (I know him\u2014know the motherfucker\u2019s name) pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me. How long. How long. Hands cuffed behind back. Cop body sits on my body pressing it down in a city street. Many shoes, boots shuffling too close to eyes. Wonder if they will stomp my eyes. Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell. Not leave-taking, not goody, good, goodbye. But return to scene of crime. Recount each blow like a senator on the Senate floor who produces cinema verit\u00e9 for his colleagues\u2014pounding rostrum POW-POW-POW-POW-POW\u2014fifty-six times in eighty-one seconds\u2014like cop fists, cop feet striking Rodney King\u2019s body fifty-six hard, loud times\u2014for eighty-one seconds\u2014ignite cities. Like the four hundred blows\u2014les quatre cents coups, as the French saying goes\u2014dirty tricks delivered blow after blow in a black-and-white movie for viewers to silently regard\u2014four hundred uncountable blows beating a boy to his knees. Different strokes for different folks in different countries. Same pain always. Whose. Whose blows. In whose language did the recorder hear Truffaut saying: I demand that a film either express the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between.\n\nAs I read, I learn more about goodbyes, farewells to the dead, about narrative art, about protests, protesters, protestations, learn that the singer Esther Phillips, n\u00e9e Jones, born colored on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas\u2014two days later and you could call her an Xmas present\u2014learn she recorded \u201cNo Headstone on My Grave,\u201d a Charlie Rich song, in 1962, eleven years before G.F. was born, with all his live years ahead of him before he\u2019s on his stomach on hard concrete or asphalt of a Minneapolis street begging for more breath, more life than he\u2019s going to get. Wondering how he hears, of all things, a blues/church-voiced woman singing words he can\u2019t quite make out, words gone quick as they come, quick as they go, but slow, too, and sad words, no doubt, very gotdamn sad brushing past, he whiffs thick sad on them, sad in a voice sad as blues and church, sad, slow, quick as a very last breath nobody ever hears anyway neck squeezed in a vise or not. . . . Oh, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t / Don\u2019t put no headstone on my grave / All my life I\u2019ve been a slave. . . . Just put me down and let me be / Free from all this misery. . . . Tell my mother not to cry. . . . Tell her that I\u2019m finally free. . . . Don\u2019t put no headstone. . . . Words passing, dangling, no place to go like the man seen dangling from a rope ain\u2019t going no place else but there where he sways in that old South story old people tell and some soul long ago snapped photos, scared the shit out him, but ain\u2019t him, ain\u2019t me, is it exactly that she sings to, sings for. Timing all wrong, and, anyway, another country, bro, and besides the wench dead (August 7, 1984). And we outlive King, too, don\u2019t we\u2014drowned (June 17, 2012) in his own swimming pool.\n\n",

        "comment": "Two young people, different colors, my color, passed me, crown of her topknot, edges of his fro glow softly above their heads when I first glanced down the street and noticed the couple busy with each other, strides synched, not hurrying, not strolling either, about half a block away walking towards me on Grand, the glow hovered, visible against early-morning light of a clear spring day framing the figures as they approached closer, pavement shadowy under their feet, sky behind them stretching up and up into bluish, then pale cloudless distance, a sky finally no color, all colors, same, different as the glow I\u2019d seen floating atop their heads.\n\nStories are graves. Empty. Nothing there. All living and dying in them fake. Pretend. No story unless someone reads, tells it. Empty. No one\u2019s time inside a story. Time needed to live and die, to tell stories. But stories not time. Stories graves. No entering or leaving them without time. Nothing breathing inside them. Lost nor found. No time. Only stories. Only words. Pretend words. Pretend time.\n\nPretend to enter, to leave, to begin. Make yourself believe you create time, are time. Contained by time. Contain time. As if time not a story you make up. Believe. As if time not a word like others you make up to tell a story .\u2009.\u2009. Once upon a time .\u2009.\u2009. as if time might end or begin, as if time waits in a story or is something like stories. As if a story contains time, or is contained by time. As if time stops or leaves or catches up or begins in stories. As if words tell time and time listens or reads. As if stories are not graves. Where we play dead. Play with the dead.\n\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n\n\nAs if the something words make of nothing is time. More time. Somewhere. Time and not a story. Not fiction. Not a grave. Make believe somewhere, something saved by telling, listening, reading. A tangible somewhere and time something that might accumulate, count. More time. More than time. Not nothing. Words. Stories. More.\n\nPerhaps, I tell myself, I have one to tell. To listen to. To read. A story does not become something until it ends, until I pretend it\u2019s over and that I am no longer experiencing a walk on Grand Street early in the morning, pretend these words, one after the other, are something like steps, mine, yours, anybody\u2019s, anyone who listens, reads for some reason and perhaps may remember steps, streets, and revisits how a morning materializes from nothing but step after step taken while darkness, brightness unfold and enfold, nothing until you are feeling, speaking one instant, one word after another, the next seeming to follow from the one before, no beginning or end, more steps, more street seeming maybe never to stop, materializing as fast and as solid as missing things suddenly recalled, things striking you as happy, painful, familiar, odd, urgent, though soon enough you also recall that nothing\u2019s there, you are alone as always with your thoughts, always alone even with a busy headful of them, including anybody else\u2019s thoughts, aches, telling stories, pretending time at your fingertips, time ahead as you take step after step along Grand, and where oh where else could you be, where are you headed this morning if not to a physical-therapy appointment at 450 Grand Street and two young people appear together, content, focussed enough on each other to match strides, colored teen-agers or very young adults coming toward you, crowns of soft light outlining hair rising above their skulls, light visible against morning\u2019s brightness, a shimmering that perhaps is source or end or both of vast brightness above them, surrounding them, but when I glance up and notice them, the word mourning somehow came to mind. Mourning\u2019s sadness, and that mourning word mine, yours, the morning mine, yours, but only one. Only once, and anyway, belongs to no one, belongs, fits nowhere, is nothing except word, story, nothing, nowhere, only a story beginning you might find yourself in the midst of unexpectedly, but of course an empty story, over and dead, a true story since they all are true and are not when you tell, listen, read.\n\nListen. I want to pretend, to believe the glow, the auras seeping from or hovering above the heads of two young people on a Lower East Side street in New York City, U.S.A., April 29, 2018, signify hope eternal, and that light above them is the same immense light I saw framing serried row after row of people not stretching to the horizon, but rows backed up at least as far as where towers, stores, windows and walls of city resumed, even the last row of shimmering crowns ablaze, maybe about to ignite the square and monumental buildings of stone enclosing them, tops of heads glowing, perhaps ready to explode and incinerate the million or so fuzzy bodies indistinguishable one from another of a crowd that had gathered to greet Nelson Mandela coming home after twenty-seven years of imprisonment, crowd whose size, whose hope ungraspable though my visitor\u2019s eyes were present, hungry witnesses peering down from Cape Castle\u2019s balcony on February 11, 1990, in Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. Inextinguishable hope one story I can imagine, maybe tell, even if a different story narrated by helicopter gunships stitching a dark net in air above the square, barricades fortified by tanks and steel rhinos packed with shock troops in camouflage that secured all streets, every entrance and exit from the space of welcoming.\n\nTime unruffled by stops and starts. Entrances, exits. Stories. Two young people pass me. Grand Street unruffled as time. Going nowhere. My steps one after another. Vanishing. Pass two young colored strangers. Remember the square in Cape Town, the teeming, excited crowd in which maybe I last saw them.\n\n",
