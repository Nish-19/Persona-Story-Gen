        "comment": "He is better at words. She is better at sentences. Games they like to play involve the former, and he wins the vast majority of them the vast majority of the time. Debates they find themselves in involve the latter, and there hasn\u2019t been an occasion (on record) of him winning one for many, many years.\n\nCrosswords, Scrabble, that new game with green and yellow squares, he excels at. Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn\u2019t support the idea that \u201cY\u201d is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like \u201cfluff,\u201d on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It\u2019s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it\u2019s not a word she would have guessed.\n\nIn defense of \u201cY\u201d \u2019s vowelness, he asks, What about \u201clynx\u201d?\n\nLynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word \u201cbobcat.\u201d\n\nWhat most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed \u201cQ.\u201d She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You\u2019re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word. But that\u2019s how you play\u2014those are the rules, he replies. She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.\n\nHow to Solve Cryptic Crosswords\n\n\nShe wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it\u2019s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don\u2019t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today\u2019s crossword demands. But why is it \u201ctank\u201d and not \u201cvest\u201d?\n\nHis vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like \u201cinput,\u201d \u201cprint,\u201d or \u201crun.\u201d Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she\u2019d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher\u2019s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word \u201conion\u201d is an onion, the \u201ci\u201d bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.\n\nHe is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes. He was raised on \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d and, whenever they watch that program together, he shouts at the people inside the television, Why are you buying vowels? His favorite category is Before and After, or, to her, the category of nonsensical phrases. \u201cNew baby buggy,\u201d for instance. She keeps getting stuck on the chronology. Isn\u2019t a baby by default new? And buggy, an outdated term for the first motorized vehicles with open tops? The Model T was a buggy, wasn\u2019t it? So, on the time line of existence, an old car should come before a new baby. That\u2019s not how any of this works, he replies. But, now that they\u2019ve touched on the chicken-and-egg problem, they have to persist. She accepts that words came before the sentence, but argues that, in the same way calculus was invented to serve physics, words were created to construct sentences. The selection and sequence of words constitute meaning. The sentence is the final boss. After thinking that over, he says, But I like calculus, and she says, Which is fine. Great, even! There\u2019s nothing wrong with calculus. She pats him on the arm.\n\nIt\u2019s called having \u201cthe last word,\u201d not \u201cthe last sentence.\u201d So we can\u2019t end there, with her patting him on the arm and going on and on about sentences. A piece of trivia dislodges in his brain: \u201ccalculus\u201d comes from the Latin for small pebble. Pebbles as used on an abacus, to count out money, votes, and distances. In medicine, the word is still used for a solid mass made from mineral salts that can form in organs or ducts. A kidney stone is a calculus. A kidney stone can cause great pain. In high school, everyone sat in metal chairs and had sore backs. Everyone groaned about calculus homework; everyone complained to the teacher, including him. But how he loved the look of the integral sign, like the curve of a beautiful neck or a musical staff. \u2666\n\n",

        "post_title": "The Fa\u00e7ade Renovation That\u2019s Going Well",
        "comment": "Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\n\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. \u201cDemolition\u201d became \u201cdemonition\u201d; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor\u2019s spokesman answered politely, \u201cVery much so, ma\u2019am.\u201d Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick fa\u00e7ade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone\u2019s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone\u2019s A.C.s. \u201cSo, no A.C.s or windows?\u201d another professor asked. \u201cAll through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?\u201d This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building\u2019s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\n\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\n\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. \u201cNo one\u2019s complained about the blue film before,\u201d the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\n\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\n\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\n\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\u2019s other meanings\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\n\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\n\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\u2014an economics professor\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\n\n\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\n\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\n\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n\n\u201cWe must withhold rent,\u201d the ethics professor said\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\n\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \u201cWe demand immediate action.\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \u201cThings like this do happen,\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\n\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. \u2666\n\n",

        "post_title": "A Children\u2019s Story",
        "comment": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there. He gives her a printout of the children\u2019s story, and she reads it. From bed, she says, \u201cYou must have footnotes with proper notation. How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n",
