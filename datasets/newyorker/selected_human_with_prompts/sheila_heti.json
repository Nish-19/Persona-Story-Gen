        "comment": "When I died, there was no one around to see it. I died all alone. It\u2019s fine. Some people think it\u2019s a great tragedy to die all alone, with no one around to see it. My high-school boyfriend wanted to marry me, because he thought the most important thing to have in life was a witness. To marry your high-school girlfriend, and have her with you all through life\u2014that is a lot of witnessing. Everything important would be witnessed by one woman. I didn\u2019t like his idea of what a wife was for\u2014someone to just hang around and watch your life unfold. But I understand him better now. It is no small thing to have someone who loves you see your life, and discuss it with you every night.\n\nInstead of marrying him, I married no one. We broke up. I lived alone. I had no children. I was the only witness to my life, while he found a woman to marry, then had a child using fertility. Her family of origin is large and lives near them\u2014same with his family of origin. I visited them one time, and at his birthday dinner there were thirty relatives and close friends, including their only child. We were at the home of his wife\u2019s parents, in the small coastal town where they were building their lives. He got exactly what he wanted. He has thirty reliable witnesses. Even if half of them die or move away or come to hate him, he still has fifteen. When he dies, he will be surrounded by a loving family, who will remember when he still had hair. Who will remember every night that he came home stinking drunk and yelling. Who will remember his every failure, and love him in spite of it all. When all his witnesses die, his life will be over. When his son is dead, and his son\u2019s wife is dead, and the children of his son are also dead, the life of my first boyfriend will be through.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

The car that hit me drove quickly away, and a driver stopped to carry me out of the center of the road. I was already dead when he carried me, so I can say I died alone.\n\nNow, you can probably tell that I\u2019m lying. If I really am O.K. with the fact that no one I loved witnessed my death, why did I come all the way back here from the dead? Why did I put on the flesh of my body, and the clothes I wore my last day on earth? Why did I resume the voice I spoke with when I was living, and return to the weight I was at the time of my death? I even washed the dirt out of my eyes and my hair, settled my teeth in the places in my mouth where they were before they got knocked out. Why did I bother doing that? It was a lot of work. I could have stayed in the ground for eternity. I could have stayed there, disintegrating, if I felt that my life was resolved. If there had not been a twinge of anxiety in me that something still needed to be said, I would still be in the ground.\n\nHere is the thing: I was a joke, and my life was a joke. The last man I loved\u2014not my high-school boyfriend\u2014told me this during our final fight. I was thirty-four at the time. During the fight, as I was trying to explain my version of things, he shouted, \u201cYou are a joke, and your life is a joke!\u201d\n\nThe night before, we loved each other still. We went to bed at the same time, and, as he read a popular crime novel on his phone, I fell asleep on my pillow, gently touching his arm. A few days later, I died. It has taken me since that time\u2014four years\u2014to understand the full significance of what he said: that I was a joke and my life was a joke. At the moment he said it, I didn\u2019t know how to reply. I was so hurt, I just began bawling. This only proved to him that he was correct. I stared at him with an open mouth. Of course, I was used to his cruelties by then, but still it hurt.\n\nWhen I received your invitation to come speak here tonight\u2014Didn\u2019t you know I had died? You did not\u2014when I received your invitation, at first I thought, No, I cannot come. The truth is I had no reason to. But then a few months later I wrote you a note: I\u2019ll come if you\u2019ll pay to dig me up. If you\u2019ll pay to fly my corpse across North America, from where I am buried, and wheel me to the mike stand, then yes, I\u2019ll come. As I flew, I worked so hard to keep in my dead brain what I wanted to say\u2014it was the whole reason I\u2019d said yes. I had something important to declare. What was it? Have I said it already? Thoughts slip from a dead brain so quickly. I can\u2019t remember if I said it.\n\n\u201cOoh are those Reeses Pieces\u201d\n\u201cOoh, are those Reese\u2019s Pieces?\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\nLying there under the ground, salt and soil and sweat and worms and seedlings and saplings and the bones of dried birds collecting in my mouth, and my blood caked dry, and my toes curled up, and my brain filled with hair and the feathers of birds, and the little white balls of whatever it is that sometimes specks the soil\u2014those little Styrofoam balls\u2014and the shit of dogs, and the piss of skunks, and the seedlings and the saplings and the acorns and the raisins; it is so amazing I could think down there, in that total, wet darkness. You never know, lying in the ground, what your niggling thought will be. You can take only one thought with you to the grave, and invariably it is a thought that bugs you, something that must be thought all the way through to the end before you find your peace. The thought I took was of a man I loved saying, \u201cYou are a joke, and your life is a joke.\u201d It cleaved to my head and my muscles and my bones, until I was nothing but those words. When my life collapsed inward\u2014which is what death is, life collapsing deep into itself\u2014that phrase remained outside the collapsing; it became a thing separate from me. And, because it was separate from me, I could take it with me\u2014it was the only thing I had.\n\nCould I have a glass of water, please? Where is my water? I am parched and I am dead. Tomorrow I will be on an airplane home, down there with all the luggage, peace in my bones, having declared what I came here to declare\u2014what I realized when I was underground. Then I will be dead for the rest of eternity, never having to brush myself off.\n\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n\n\nThe man who said I was a joke and my life was a joke\u2014he may not have been there in my final moments, witnessing my final breath, but what I realized was: he foretold my death. He could only have foretold it by seeing me to my core\u2014by having been my soul\u2019s witness. When he said those awful words, he witnessed me into the future, a future he knew I would meet. During our fight, I tried to convince him that he was wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not a joke!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou\u2019re the joke! You\u2019re the joke!\u201d\n\nWhen a person slips on a banana peel and dies, then her life is a joke. Slipping on a banana peel is not how I died. When a person walks into a bar with a rabbi, a priest, and a nun, and that is how she dies, then her life is a joke. That is not how I died. When a person is a chicken who crosses the road to get to the other side, and that is how she dies, then her life is a joke. Well, that is how I died\u2014as a chicken crossing the road to get to the other side.\n\nWhen I crossed the road that day, it was to the other side I was heading\u2014that was how much despair I felt, our fight still in my mind. Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. A suicide. The other side is death. Everyone knows that, right?\n\nI scurried out in front of that rusty old car, and smashed myself into the metal, my teeth pushed back into my throat by the fender, my chest completely run over.\n\nI didn\u2019t come here to depress you. I came here to tell you a joke. Or, rather, to show you a joke. Me! And to brag that I was witnessed. That first boyfriend of mine\u2014he doesn\u2019t live far from here. Perhaps he is in the audience, listening? Having a beer? I hope he\u2019s here! My life and death were witnessed, I tell you! Witnessed and foretold! You did not fare any better than me. It seems both of us won, in the end.\n\nWhat a chicken I was. I couldn\u2019t bear any aspect of living. Especially that old custom: that you have to live a better life than everyone else.\n\nWhat is the other side like, you may be wondering. Since I\u2019m here, I might as well tell you: it\u2019s a ridiculous place where everyone is always laughing. It\u2019s like something I experienced once, on a transcontinental flight. This woman beside me laughed at every dumb joke in whatever show she was watching, literally every joke the show made. Then she watched another show, then another one. Her laughter filled our row of seats. She didn\u2019t stop laughing from takeoff to landing. How a person\u2019s laughter can make you hate her! Don\u2019t the laughers of the world know this? Do they think it makes them lovable? Who likes to hear someone laughing to herself, headphones on, while staring at a screen? Probably the same people who like to listen to strangers fuck behind a hotel wall.\n\nOver there on the other side, it\u2019s like that all the time\u2014the dogs laugh, the trees laugh, everyone laughs\u2014whether there\u2019s anything funny or not. I practiced this speech on the other side, before an audience of sixteen people, and it took four hours, from beginning to end, as I waited after saying each sentence for the laughter to subside. Here on earth it is different, of course. The quiet of the living is one of the great reliefs. Is death the same for everyone, or is this laughing world a death made just for me? How can I know for sure?\n\n\nDoes anything I\u2019m saying make any sense? I\u2019m self-conscious about my speaking. Does my voice sound all right? When you are dead, it\u2019s difficult to carry a thought. My head feels stuffed with cotton batting; my eyes feel stuffed with cotton balls; my ears feel plugged up with cotton. It is hard to think, to string meaning to meaning. I did not come here to tell you I love you. Is that what you think I am saying? I only loved two men ever. One of them wanted to marry me, and the other thought my life was a joke. My first boyfriend found himself a witness, and I have come to declare that I found one, too. I won, you see? I won! I won the best thing a person can win\u2014to be seen! I declare it here today. It\u2019s the only reason I crawled into my flesh to stand here before you\u2014a joke on this stage. His words no longer hurt me. They make me feel so proud.\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road? That\u2019s me. I am the chicken. And I got to the other side. He knew this would happen when he spoke those words. How beautiful to be seen. \u2666\n\n",

        "comment": "The whole world could still be gray, as it was in the past, in those old movies. But then one day colors came, sometime between then and here. I think it must have been the wars. After the wars people said, We need some reason to be less upset. Someone suggested, Colors? The world agreed that colors were needed, to pull everyone out of the despair of the dying, and all those piled-up bones. Colors were brought in. They were just carted in on trucks, and everyone took their fill. It was a job for every person on the planet to put colors where they ought to be. Some things were decided in advance, like making the grass green, and you\u2019d get a ticket if you made yours red or blue. But other things you could decide, like the color of your shirt. It was a small committee of people who made the big decisions, they were necessary, but then so was every humble individual, doing their own job. The world sighed in relief: everything was so much more beautiful now! And for several days there were no wars, just people enjoying the colors, but humans adapt quickly to what is beautiful and nice, and then the wars started up again, and the committee was disbanded.\n\nA long time ago I was part of this committee\u2014not the original one, but the commemorative one, made up of the committee\u2019s daughters. We gathered to take notes about what had really happened in those conversations, so that we could tell the world. We asked our fathers, What was it like to be on the committee? How did the meetings go? But they had lost their memories, some of them, and others were angry at the other committee members, and wouldn\u2019t tell us why. We gathered very little information to save for the world, for posterity. Then we disbanded, too. We said to ourselves, Let\u2019s just enjoy the colors. Who cares how they got here? So we did. We became just like everyone else, not archivists of the past, but regular folks walking through the colors of the present, as if we didn\u2019t know anything.\n\nThen, one day, Amanda thought we should actually just talk to the people of the world who had participated in dispersing colors over the land, just regular folk, the ones who did it. The rest of the daughters were tired, but I wanted to do it with her, because I liked her and it sounded fun. I asked if she thought I should bring my movie camera, and she said yes, we could make a documentary. We went to a little town and just stood in the square and accosted people who were going about their Sunday shopping and asked them what it was like when there started to be colors, and had they participated in coloring everything? We only asked the old people. Most people didn\u2019t want to talk to us, but one old woman did. She invited us back to her apartment for tea.\n\nHer apartment was full of colors, just like the rest of the world, except for one corner, which was still gray. It was her own secret corner that hadn\u2019t been colored\u2014perhaps the only place in the world like this! The world would have been agitated to know that a corner had not been filled in; but she said that in fifty years, sixty, seventy, she had not let anyone in. She preferred to give up husbands and friends, so she could keep one corner of the world not colored.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nIt was clearly restful to her to have it, as restful as a little gray mouse that\u2019s a friend. Oh, she told us, as she spoke for the camera, avoiding eye contact with it, her fingers playing with her teacup on her little china saucer, it was all anyone could talk about\u2014what color are you going to make this? What color are you going to make that? Isn\u2019t it all so beautiful now? How did we ever live with all that grayness? Why did it take the world so long? Isn\u2019t it nice how we are all co\u00f6perating?\n\nShe was making little sour expressions as she imitated those people from so long ago, many of whom were dead now, she said. She had got into the craze for a little while too, coloring everything in sight, even things that weren\u2019t in her jurisdiction to color, like the neighbor\u2019s fencing.\n\nBut one day she returned to her apartment, where she hadn\u2019t yet filled in the corner. She had been coloring other things, she had just put it off. She thought, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow. She told us this with downcast eyes. And what happened? Well, tomorrow turned into tomorrow, as it does for so many of us. It kept appearing on her to-do list, like one of those items that are there for so many months you don\u2019t even notice them anymore. And the months turned to years, and somehow she never did it. What is it with those things that never make it off the list? Is it that we actually don\u2019t want to do them? Or that we don\u2019t even need to do them? We put them on there because we think we should. Why don\u2019t we just take them off already? So finally she took it off, and by that time the world didn\u2019t even have enough color left that she could use to fill in the corner.\n\nShe stayed in that apartment\u2014various friends encouraged her to move, for the immigrants were moving into her building, and so her friends thought that she ought to move. But, although she wasn\u2019t a fan of the immigrants, she didn\u2019t mind them so much, they were nice neighbors, and that dull corner reassured her in a funny little way. She looked at it every day as she took her tea. No, she didn\u2019t have anybody over, and, yes, her lovely immigrant neighbors thought she was a snob, but really what was she supposed to do if one of them found out, and said something to somebody? She couldn\u2019t take the risk. And so she didn\u2019t take the risk. She finally stood up to let us out, very very sadly. She told us to please not air our documentary, or write about it, until she died. She wanted to live with that little corner like that until she died, and not be taken away or to jail, or for somebody from some committee to come and color it in, so we agreed, because we felt sorry for her, and we liked her.\n\nWell, she finally died last year, and next week our documentary airs, but we are sad about it. Mostly we wish we hadn\u2019t been waiting for this anniversary, the one-year anniversary of her death, with the sort of desire everyone feels to show the world what they\u2019ve made. We\u2019re proud of the short film we created, and that we found this story, but not that she had to die in order for us to put it into the world. Better that she had lived, and lived with her corner, than that we got to show our film. Why is there always so much sadness when something good occurs, a balance between the good and the bad? Couldn\u2019t she have said, Show your film to the world! and felt safe that no one cared any longer about one little corner not being filled in? No, but perhaps she knew something we did not, about colors, and grayness, and corners, and what is allowed to you in your privacy, in your tiny little apartment, and what is not.\n\n",
