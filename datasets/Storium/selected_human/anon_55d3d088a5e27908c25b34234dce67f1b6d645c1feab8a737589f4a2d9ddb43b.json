Short regular bursts is good news.  They have seen nothing out of the ordinary.  But irregular calls are a warning.  Something is out of place.\n\nAll round the valley, from mountains to forests to meadows, those who were awake at this hour and knew these calls looked across at its source.\n\nThe River Trill.  More specifically, the Cedar Bridge.  One of the bridges that allowed Birdfolk to travel from Krannik to smaller settlements such as Kaliw and Groon.  \n\nNormally, the water would twinkle under the bridge.\n\nNot this morning.  Something was blocking the light.\n\nIt was not hard to guess what - and for sure, there were plenty who would be quick to speculate.\n\nTrolls had taken up residence under the bridge.\n\nProbably Ruggorshar and Pimicle.  They were always up to cause trouble, with their mud-minded hangers on.\n\nThis was *disruptive*.\n\nDisruptive, and needless - the wolves were growing in number, and the trolls could have focused their energies on eating them and so keeping everyone happy.\n\nIt was disruptive to the *Birdfolk*.   They would be reluctant to use the bridge, so trade and communications would be inconvenienced and delayed.  This would lead to more calls for trolls to be pushed further back to the other side of the mountains, which would annoy the trolls and cause tension and tit-for-tat \"incidents.\"\n\nIt was disruptive to the *Golems*.  In truth, it was probably to spite the Golems that the bridge had been occupied.  \n\nIf the Golems did nothing, the Trolls would take more and more liberties until they achieved a reaction.  \n\nYou could see how it might play out.  In the end a Birdperson might go missing. Trolls would be blamed.  Golems would be condemned for failing to act sooner.\n\nAnd of course - they, the Golems, were constructed to stand against \"the darkness\".  What is the point of them, the cry would be, if they do nothing?\n\nYet, let the Golems act, and just see what happens.  As soon as Golems were to protest, or move in, or do *anything* in fact, the Troll chiefs would make noise.  Complain of unfounded allegations, telling lies, jumping to conclusions.\n\n\nBack and forth the arguments would go, until arguments become incidents, incidents become stand-offs.  \n\nAnd stand-offs become war.\n\nAnd it was *disruptive* to the *Trolls*.\n\nRuggorshar was as manipulative as Pimicle was vicious.\n\nIf the Troll chiefs let any perceived slight pass without making a rumpus, Ruggorshar will whip up discontent.  The Chiefs have become soft, he would say; they are giving ground to the Golems, they have signed a pact with the Birdfolk, they have abandoned their people.  Stirring the pot, weakening unity in the hope of gaining from despair.\n\nSo, the Troll Chiefs have to defend the indefensible, whilst trying to smooth things over - as any escalation will just give Ruggorshar another chance to magnify their perceived failures, and move closer to the day when he topples them from their leadership."

This divide is symbolised by distinct zones within the city, each with its own rules and challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n**1. The Upper Echelons - The Privileged Elite**\r\n   - *Location:* High above the city, the wealthy elite reside in luxurious penthouses and high-tech residences, basking in the comfort of their cyber-enhanced lifestyles.\r\n   - *Lifestyle:* The Upper Echelons enjoy unparalleled access to advanced technology, impeccable security, and extravagant entertainment. Weapons are considered a status symbol and are prominently displayed as decor.\r\n   - *Use of Weapons:* Weapons are primarily ornamental, reserved for displays of power and prestige. Discharging a weapon here is a grave offence, usually leading to severe consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. The Middle Ground - The Struggling Enhanced (Mods)**\r\n   - *Location:* Between the opulence of the elite and the desperation of the slums lies the Middle Ground, where Mods with aspirations dwell.\r\n   - *Lifestyle:* These Mods work tirelessly to pay for their enhancements, hoping to ascend to the Upper Echelons. Their lives are characterised by constant competition and ambition.\r\n   - *Use of Weapons:* While weapons can be carried, they are expected to be used only in self-defence. Mods are caught in a perpetual struggle for status and advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. The Conurbation - A Blend of Rich and Poor**\r\n   - *Location:* This area sits at the heart of the city, representing a transitional zone between wealth and poverty.\r\n   - *Lifestyle:* Here, a mix of the rich and poor coexist. While some enjoy relative comfort, others struggle to make ends meet. The Conurbation hosts bustling markets, entertainment venues, and a diverse population.\r\n   - *Use of Weapons:* Carrying weapons is common, but discharging them should be limited to acts of self-defence. The Conurbation serves as a melting pot of culture and commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n**4. The Outer Fringes - Facing Poverty and Lawlessness**\r\n   - *Location:* Moving away from the city centre, the Outer Fringes witness a rise in poverty and a decline in order.\r\n   - *Lifestyle:* Residents here face economic hardships, limited access to technology, and basic amenities. Survival is a daily struggle.\r\n   - *Use of Weapons:* In the Outer Fringes, weapons are readily used for both protection and aggression. Law enforcement is scarce, and vigilante justice is common.\r\n\r\n\r\n**5. The Wastelands - A Desolate, Lawless Abyss**\r\n   - *Location:* Beyond the city's boundaries lies the desolate Wastelands, a harsh and lawless territory.\r\n   - *Lifestyle:* The Wastelands are characterised by extreme pollution, an absence of law, and a return to a primitive existence. Those who venture here do so at their own peril.\r\n   - *Use of Weapons:* In the Wastelands, weapons are a way of life, essential for survival in a hostile environment. Conflict and chaos reign supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Urban Divide of Neo Elysia paints a vivid portrait of societal inequality, where the haves and have-nots are separated by both physical and metaphorical barriers. As your characters navigate these zones, they will encounter diverse challenges, choices, and opportunities, each contributing to the rich tapestry of the cyberpunk narrative."

But also uncertainty.\n\nEarth\u2019s contribution to the Galactic community was not as fantastic as they sometimes allowed themselves to believe.  Human sneakiness sometimes gave them an edge over the wisdom or inventiveness of other species, and allowed them to circumnavigate the will of brute aggression.  But of course that by no means meant that everything they did with their influence was uncompromisingly beneficial.  Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell.\n\nOne thing Earth did do well, however, was conferences.  Their great gift to the cosmos.  Wonderful melting pots of social etiquette, good coffee, and strangely flavoured vol-au-vents.\n\nNathan Smoltz\u2019s Conference Badge making company -  Intergalactic Badge Services - had ridden high on the buoyant intergalactic conference business - and came crashing down when Earth\u2019s Empire became a spent force.  No one was happier than Nathan when the Galactic Federation started to cumulate, bringing with it as it did a series of meetings, congresses, and conferences.\n\nA new golden age of badge making was being ushered in.\n\nStill, he was a bit jittery.\n\nThis was a big conference, and a big event.\n\nThe Alpha Centaurians were nice enough but a bit...well, creepy.  They were various hues of green, quite tall, and notable by the single, large eye that dominated their bulbous heads, also marked by thick blood vessels.  They looked, he thought, a bit like vertical caterpillars, with several tentacle-like arms terminating in claws.  They were very keen that everything went smoothly.\n\nAt the last minute, as Nathan saw it, he was asked not only to prepare the badges, but also ensure only the right people came in, give directions, and keep everyone moving.\n\nThe Alpha Centaurians were very proud of their cultural heritage.  The whole event was to be hosted in what seemed like a great art gallery, with winding corridors displaying great works of art, little ante-rooms housing portfolios of poetry, and three \u201clistening rooms\u201d where music would be performed to help delegates unwind.  In Nathan\u2019s opinion, they would *need* to unwind, after getting half-lost wandering around it all.\n\nIt was arranged over 5 floors (of great architecture, let it be noted) with the reception and food court at the entrance level, the main conference hall on the first floor, the suites of delegates on the second floor, some break-out meeting rooms on the third floor, two theatres and two listening rooms on the fourth floor, and on the fifth floor was the grandest of the listening rooms and some more suites for guests.  Everywhere was a maze of corridors to maximise the opportunities to display art, with alcoves boasting sculptures.  Grand stairways went up from either side of the reception, with lifts strategically arranged around the place to provide more opportunities for artistic displays.\n\n*\u201cThe Xlanthius delegation is already here -as are the Ice Warriors.  The Malcassairo\u2019s have only just confirmed so they are not on the official list but should be welcomed\u201d* purred Hecto Shellac, the Alpha Centarian giving Nathan most of his orders.  Their voice was feminine to Nathan's ears, but that was just his human perspective.\n\n*\"Treat the observer from Peladon patiently,\"* they continued,  *\"we are hoping they will join us formally...steer the Draconians and Thoros-Beta Mentors to the top floor please... ah, look, I will write it down for you, so you know who goes where.\u201d*"

They were treated like minor royals.\n\nPlush apartment rooms like a top hotel were provided in a complex which by a network of corridors was linked to the filming studio itself.  Food, drink - even wardrobe and makeup.  Everything necessary for both a comfortable stay and appearance on the show.  \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nA few of the winning contestants came back this way, too.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe TVs in the rooms streamed all the various shows of Moriscomb Media, the parent company of *Reiley Mayhem*.\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the run up their appearance on the show, Phesteh, styled \u201ccontract manager\u201d talked them through everything they needed to know.  He was a rather epicene man, who wore rather too much baby oil on his face for a man of his age.\n&nbsp;\nHe gave them a quick reference guide to the rules, whilst advising them that they did not strictly apply.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n*\u201cThese are the official rules.  They are a good guide to what will happen, but they are only a guide.  You get to pick a room each time - free choice.  One of the studio managers will give help if you need it.  Usually you play alone, but sometimes you are up against another contestant - but I am sure you have seen the format.  On screen it will look like Reiley is with you all the time - the reality is he has a lot to get through, and your appearances will be quickly edited.  We usually do you in batches of three as that is easier, but sometimes we will hook you up with other contestants if that helps with the game narrative.  Don\u2019t take any risks you don\u2019t want to, it's your choice - if you could just sign these disclaimers. If anything bad happens it\u2019s all insured, but you can\u2019t claim more than ten thousand drachmas - more than that and you need to make your own insurance arrangements, okay?\"*\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nHe rattled on before they had time to take it all in.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\"*Now I have to tell you about the prize money.  On that side you will be well looked after - I mean, that\u2019s why people come on the show.  It says that you pay a hundred drachmas - provided you play by the rules and see the game through its normal run you don\u2019t have to pay anything, whether you win or not.  If you quit outside of the rules or we have to dismiss you then you will owe that amount.*\"\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nDrachmas?\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*\"The drachma is a volatile currency.  Volatile in a good way.  It\u2019s likely to go up - your final prize fund will be very generous.  But should the currency collapse, we have that covered.  Anything past the fifth challenge and you are sure of a small fortune in your local currency.  There will be other deals along the way - you might get sponsorships, or other opportunities.  Under the contract we get a cut of anything that spins off from the show.\u201d*\n\n*\"Here are your Pass cards.  You can use them twice during the competition...\"*\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce that had all been rushed through, they were ushered into the green room, got camera ready, and ushered out into the main studio.  Stage hands were all around, making sure everything and everyone was in the right place at the right time.\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;"

        "comment": "##Base camp, New Eden\n\nThe group made their way through a range of terrain.  Jungle, woods, bush, and what the map called farmland, which did indeed look fertile and ready for use, and indeed which had various cultivated plants already growing on it.\n\nThere were snags - thickets to cut through, rivers to work around - even a wasp nest to avoid!  However, they made it, at last, to *base camp*.\n\nFelix was delighted with everything about base camp.\n\nIt was of course very basic - almost an anti-climax from the beauty of what they had seen en route. \n\nFlat, even coarse grass with a few tiny shelters. \n\nSierra noted the grass was the sort which would be hard wearing and not grow too long - like an outdoor carpet.\n\nBut it meant it was a blank canvas. They could do what they wanted here. There was enough shelter for everyone to have sufficient privacy in the short term, and in the longer term they could build better homes. Perhaps cabins - maybe even tree houses!\n\nIn all directions there was greenery of different hues - forest, jungle, scrubland. Mountains ranged where they had not explored yet. \n\nFelix spoke to others excitedly about the great waterfall and lake which the website said was nearby. There was still so much to find, he told the others.\n\nThe farm would need a lot of work - but there was already growing yam, arrowroot, potatoes, plus some berries and bananas. June also found a lime tree!\n\nThere would be enough food for some decent carbs, and there were also some bushes of fragrant herbs which would change the taste. \n\nAccording to the blog, many food plants were available nearby - it was a question of foraging in the short term, and cultivating and taking cuttings longer term.\n\nFelix also found a little cache of tools. A couple of saws wrapped in an oiled cloth. But also there were some more rudimentary wood cutting tools, made from bits of stone - like flint tools, though he was not sure it was technically flint. Some had been bound into wooden handles.\n\n\u201cGuys, I think I can see what we need to do here. You see these modern tools? They will help break the back of big cutting jobs. But we should use them sparingly, and maintain them well, so they do not break or become useless. Once a job is started, and it is possible to use these more basic tools, we should use them instead, as they can be replaced. We do the tough work with the best, and then it will be easy to finish with the primitive! It\u2019s a bit like me and my glasses. I am keeping my \u201creal\u201d ones for best - whenever I do anything that may risk them, I will try to use my replacements.\u201d\n\n\n\n---\n\nThey were happy.  There was so much to be hopeful about, and all the signs were that this would really work.\n\nHowever, they had their doubts.  Of course they did.\n\nSome thought about those they had left behind; or worried if everyone would work properly together and do what was best for themselves - and each other.  Maybe they could help steer the society towards having some sort of order.\n\nAs they rested, they reflected on their journey.  The flights from various places to get to the port: then the journey by ship - and at last the covert escape by boat.\n\nAmazingly, they had actually done it!  They realised that now the time was to get to know one another properly, and plan for the future.  Maybe first, they needed to truly understand themselves."

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the streets, there were many who were wishing for a better life. Some yearned for wealth and prosperity, while others craved love and companionship. But alas, not all wishes come true.*\n\n*In a dimly lit corner of the city, there sat a man named Edward. He was a simple man, with simple desires. All he wanted was a warm meal and a place to lay his head at night. But despite his best efforts, he had never been able to make ends meet. As he trudged through the streets, his stomach growling with hunger, he couldn't help but feel like the world was against him.*\n\n*And then there was Mary. She had always dreamed of finding her soulmate, a man who would cherish her and love her for who she was. But despite her many attempts at love, she had been met with disappointment and heartbreak at every turn. She was beginning to lose hope that she would ever find true love.*\n\n*As the night wore on, Edward and Mary found themselves walking along the same path. They didn't know each other, but there was a sense of camaraderie between them. They were both people who had been let down by life, and they found solace in each other's company.*\n\n*And then something strange happened. As they walked, they stumbled upon a mysterious figure who offered them each a wish. Edward wished for a warm meal and a place to stay, while Mary wished for a true love that would never leave her side.*\n\n*But as the night wore on, they both realized that their wishes had been in vain. Edward's warm meal turned out to be cold, and his place to stay was infested with rats. And Mary's true love turned out to be nothing more than a passing fancy.*\n\n*As they sat together, cold and hungry and alone, they realized that sometimes the things we wish for are not the things we truly need.*\n\n*It was a story that repeated many times, throughout human history.*\n\n*But, sometimes, fools had trusted in magical beings to fulfil their wishes.  Seldom did this end well.*\n\n*Most, if they lived to regret their decision at all, saw themselves as fighting a power that would always be greater than them.*\n\nBut one man refused to accept this fate...\n\n\n----\n\n\n#\u201cBurned by the things you wish for?\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\nSo read the eye-catching headline of a blog that circulated throughout the vast expanse of the internet. The alluring title captured the attention of many, and soon, small ads began appearing in newspapers across the world, drawing readers to its pages. Some were drawn in by the mere mention of it, while others took a chance and delved deeper into its contents, seeking the secrets it held.\n\nThe topics covered by the blog were both ordinary and fantastical, enough to pique the interest of those who stumbled upon it. But for a select few, the words carried a weight that only they could comprehend. They felt as if they had finally found someone who understood their plight, and the prospect of gaining justice against the elusive creatures that held their fate in their hands.\n\nUnder the name Candent, a figure reached out to these individuals, offering them the chance to band together and achieve retribution for their unfulfilled desires. They exchanged electronic and postal messages, building a camaraderie and trust among themselves until just a mere few received an invitation to gather at an address in Old Hill, Chislehurst, London, England.\n\nOf the few, only a couple dared to arrive at the appointed hour.\n\n\"Candent\" was not disappointed by the no-shows, but more delighted that he had found a pair who truly had the courage to follow through.\n\nBut little did they know, the path they had chosen would be fraught with danger, and the consequences of their actions could prove to be disastrous."

Times before they had been repelled, but this time they were organised and determined.

        "comment": "Our tale begins in a homely, comfortable tavern, with a fire flickering in the grate.\n\nThis is very good fortune.\n\nHad you joined us several days ago, you would have seen a dwarf, an elf and a halfling in a most unhappy state - trapped beneath their own upturned waggon, sealed in by the silk of a giant spider, and about to be consumed by her hatchlings.\n\nOn that occasion, however, all had not been lost, as it might have first appeared.  By good fortune, a party of halflings and goblins happened along, and saved our friends from a most unpleasant fate.\n\nIt may surprise you to learn that halflings and goblins were associated together.  But these were fallen times.  Elf Mountain was in the hands of the Garginoids - thuggish, unpleasant creatures.  As a result, the Jinta crystal - the true power behind the mountain, and indeed the land - was stifled, unable to radiate its goodness.\n\nThis led to failure of crops, hardening of hearts, and cooling of friendships.\n\nFrom a time of plenty and harmony, the land descended into want and suffering.\n\nAnd so it happened that halflings had to up and leave their homes, and in their hunger and desperation even goblins would work with such, if it meant they could defend a trading operation so as to eek out a living.\n\nIt came to pass therefore that an unlikley grouping of creatures stood by the side of the road leading past Gemchester.\n\nPeriwick - the halfling lead negotiator in a trading partnership with Haldon Blacktoes and a number of other halflings and goblins, forced into an alliance of convenience by their need to survive.\n\nZolon -  a rather disheveled looking Halfling, but secretly a Scout in a mission to retake Elf Mountain.\n\nYotmuck the dwarf - a most ignoble example of his race, worrying currently about the contents of his spoiled waggon\n\nZentha, a most unorganised example of an elven scout.\n\nZolon knew he was at rock bottom.  He had been hurt, and needed treatment.  He knew that even yet, he may not survive.\n\nWith nothing less to lose, he was open about his plans.\n\nThe others there saw it was not a good plan.  But it was a plan where few others exisited; and would represent at least an attempt to deal with an evil could not be left unchecked any longer.\n\nIt was now, or never.\n\nThey were a most unlikely, rag tag bunch. And yet, it dawned upon them, that amongst this assembly was likely to be the core of an attack on Elf Mountain. An attempt to take it back. There was little chance of success. But failure was not an option, and there was unlikely to be a Plan B any time soon.\n\n\nPeriwick had looked at the others and said,\n\n\u201cThis is no place to talk. Up this road towards Lime Pass - keep walking about five hours and you will happen upon a tavern. It\u2019s called The Good Frog - a strange name in these times but it is safe.\n\nTake a room there. Give me a day. I will be there in due course, with as many as I can muster, and a means of transport. We will complete the journey. Together.\u201d\n\nYotmuck stepped forward.\n\n\u201cHe will not walk. I have not salvaged much from my waggon, but what I have I will trade to fund a carridge or ponies. I will travel with him to the tavern. We will wait for you. I trust you will come good, Periwick.\u201d\n\nYotmuck had helped Zolon to The Good Frog.\n\nPeriwick had made discrete enquiries of others in Gemchester, to see who might be persuaded to join them.\n\n\nAnd, as I started by saying, we find one another in a good tavern, as new allies assemble.\n\nZolon had slept there for several days, as strong medicine helped him heal.\n\nWhen at last he was fully back on his feet, he headed down to the dining area where there was food, and, perhaps more importantly, the assembled group who had elected to join him on his quest."

A chance for him to show how great and strong and wise he was.  Anything that might challenge the pecking order...that might suggest his grip was failing...this could not be left to chance.  Peace and prosperity was dependent upon the Emperor commanding the respect and confidence of all.\n\nBut there was another buzz starting to grow in the city.  People whispering, one to another.  Shock.  Giggles.  Shaking heads from those who could not, would not believe the stories that were circulating....\n\n\n---\n\n\n###Jennifer Trimm, the Mistress of the Robes, \nwas starting to hear some of those strange stories - just fragments, but she was determined to get to the bottom of them.  \n\nAt first, because she was simply intrigued.\n\nBut then, because she stared to get the uneasy feeling it might affect her...\n\nFor her afternoon break, she had wandered into one of the fancy tea-rooms just near the Palace.  A good place to socialise with the very best in society - and enjoy some excellent cake, and of course the finest tea the town had to offer.\n\nIn whispered conversations, there was cheeky talk ... talk that seemed to involve the Emperor.  Seemed to involve his clothes.  As Mistress of the Robes, that was very close to home ... and she had sold off a bundle of his clothes this very lunchtime ... She had understood that he had purchased some new garments from those merchants who had been to see him.  She had tried to block it, herself, she did not trust him; but you do not argue with the Emperor.  Now what was all this idle talk about his clothes.... and she was in it deep for having sold some of them?\n\n\n---\n\n###Lukas Pal, Royal Messenger.\n\nHe was fast.  That was his job.  But today, he was faster than ever - propelled in no small part by the mighty gust of the (naked, as it happened - but rude to notice) Emperor's yells.  And, indeed, the royal foot.\n\n***\"My clothes! They have gone to the incinerator!  Catch them before they are burned!\"***\n\nHe hesitated, understandably confused.\n\n***\u201cMessenger, go get my clothes back. Or die.\u201d***\n\nSo he scrambled down the corridor, down the stairs, past the butler, pretty much through the footman (and was now wearing some Royal roast dinner)...to the incinerator. \n\nFrantically, he had started pulling things from the flames, and great cost to his fringe and eyebrows, before the incinerator sweeper had managed to get out of him what the problem was.\n\n----\n\n###Anna O'Donnell,  incinerator sweeper \n\n\"Oh no, those clothes were not burned.  They were taken to the housekeeper's assistant, to turn into blankets for the local poor.  Come, I will show you.\"\n\nAnna was duly propelled along by the frantic messenger, passing through a great barrow of leaves and various other refuse that was being wheeled in.\n\n\n---\n\n###Kyle Ackleson, Housekeeper's assistant.\nKyle was surprised to see the messenger and Anna bursting in.  And perturbed that Anna was after the clothes back.  He had thought it was settled that they were surplus to requirements.\n\nGood news - they had not been cut up.\n\nBad news - they were not here, either.\n\n\n---\n\n\n###Walter Lackey, Merchant.\n\nMeanwhile, a merchant stood near the city gates, by the coach-house.\n\nHis plan had been to travel out of town, to find the best possible price for his...latest acquisition.\n\nBut now, that did not seem such a great idea.\n\nFirst of all, there were so many wealthy merchants - and, indeed, fine people from far and wide - pouring through the city gates, he was sure he could make a good profit right here.\n\nBesides that, it was difficult to conceal the sheer opulence of the clothes he had bundled up.  That was getting him some rather...unwanted attention.  He had not really thought the security issue through.  Maybe a quick sale would be wise - before they were taken from him by some gang of ruffians..."

Peace reigned in the Seven Kingdoms for many years. \n\nThen, the destruction - nay, theft - of the remote town of Frostvale was an ominous sign that the Dark Wizards threatened a return. An unlikely bunch of stalwart heroes responded to the call of Derlin, the then Prince on the Dragon Throne, to uncover the truth behind the destruction and stop the culprits.  Their quest took them into a magical realm and into adventures they could never have imagined.  They returned victorious - restoring Frostvale to its rightful place, and returning with the Wizards to be held account for their deeds.\n\nPeace now seemed assured, with the magical realm destroyed and the Wizards no longer plotting revenge.  Frostvale was a thriving market town once again.  \n\nHowever, not all is calm.  Besides the cut-and thrust of petty rivalries, monsters and magical anomalies began to emerge, and in recent months became more frequent.   Could it be that the magic which once threatened the peace is not entirely consigned to the past?\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThis is a classic fantasy setting (dwarves, elves, wizards and paladins included) -  it is an open world sandbox.\n\nYou are encouraged to write your own cards and to add moves without cards.\n",

        "comment": "#Frostvale\n##Introduction\n\n---\n\n*Usually, the pictures I use are very intentional and meant to be taken literally.  A little detail just might mean to be there!*\n\n*That's not quite the case with this opening picture.  I do not intend to tie us down to an actual map of Frostvale.  The relative position between places might be important here and there, but on the whole not.*\n\n*The picture above is meant to give an impression, not to be an accurate representation of anything.  (By the way, click on it, and you will see it in full).*\n\n*It's actually 2 images. In the background is an impression of what Frostvale town looks like.  Indeed, in as much as you can make anything out from the banner pic, I always imagine you can see bits of Frostvale, poking out of the trees.*\n\n*In the foreground is a rough map of main walkways.  You see small boats come in on one side - they will be on the other side, too, and it looks like there are some round at the south.  There is a long walkway in the middle, with lots going off, actually, **up**.*\n\n*As I say, it is not a map, and can only begin to give you a picture of what it is like to be in Frostvale.  Take that, and overlay it with a written description....*\n\n---\n\n---\n\nLong ago, Frostvale was a castle.  Defending who from what is not clear, but they built it well.  Four tall towers gave a good view and made an impression on they eye.  Those towers, and most of the walls, were still there.\n\nSo it is, that Frostvale could be seen more as one huge building than a town, though a town it surely is.  The great walls and what would have been battlements now held shops on many levels, as did the towers.  The centre was open, allowing daylight to come into the central part, but every available space had been utilised in some way.\n\nFor as long as can be remembered, its location was important because it offered a resting point on a long waterway (part river, part canal) that linked two very important river networks which were vital to transport and trade.  A series of locks allowed boats to move freely in either direction.  The waterway was wide and deep.  You would have been hard pressed to get a full ship along it (though it had been known, apparently!) but certainly some pretty big boats.  Most however were barge-type vessels loaded with goods; and a few fishers.\n\nRoutes south were not great, but used by some for continuing or joining journeys.  \n\nNorth, there were the mountains.  Huge, and virtually uncrossable.  Nothing much of value was known to be there, though who knows.  There are some dangers in the form of creatures, deep in the mountains, but it was the terrain and climate that posed the greatest risk.  Besides, there was nothing worth crossing them for.  Probably another Kingdom, if you went far enough - though it would be easier by far to go by land and sea another way.  A nation of Kobolds was most likely that way - but much too far to be worth thinking about.\n\nRoundabout, there were a few little hamlets and settlements eking out a living.  Some might supply eggs and other crops to the town.\n\nJust near the town, to either side, are the remains of trading centres that sprang up during the period of Frostvale's ... absence.  They were redundant now, though some continued to live there, and carry on some sort of trade.\n\nBut, those things apart, there was very little sign of other life for a long way in any direction. There were mountains, forests, planes, and the waterway, with the dramatic Falls.  (There was also  a strange building jutting out of the cliff, which was once a church, and was now a prison).\n\nI talked about the *absence* of Frostvale.  Some few years back, the place disappeared.  Totally - leaving just a strange, mighty, black crater where it once stood.\n\nIt had been taken, wholesale, into another dimension.  And through no small effort by a heroic few, in due course, returned.  You might think there would be some physical evidence of its movement.\n\nActually, there was very little.  Frostvale did not go anywhere, physically.  It did not bump or scrape.   While it was gone, some moss, stone, mud and water egressed into the space it once held in this dimension, and when it returned, that was pushed out, with some residual marking.  When it was first taken, a strange black fire appeared to consume it, though this was not so much burning it up as taking it away.  If you knew where to look, you might see little cracks or marks or darkening here or there, but then again, it could just be your imagination...\n\n\nSo let us talk about Frostvale...\n\n---"
