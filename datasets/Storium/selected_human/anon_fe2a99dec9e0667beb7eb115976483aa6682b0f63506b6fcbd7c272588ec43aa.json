Almost a century ago, the Abbey was founded. Formerly an abandoned monastery, it now houses a secretive colony of over one hundred carefully selected artists from all over the world. \n\nOf those who go in, many emerge to gain fame and renown, others to teach at well known schools, and still others take paths of their own choosing. Some simply stay, and vacancies are few and far between. Happily, four have recently opened up. You and three fortunate others have been chosen to fill them.\n\nBut all is not as it seems.  Whatever your unique way of perceiving and expressing the world is, be ready to use it. As the Abbey falls into jeopardy, you\u2019ll need what\u2019s always felt a little like magic.\n\n*\u201dLife imitates art far more than art imitates Life.\u201d*\n*-- Oscar Wilde*\n\n[Click here for a map of the Abbey.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7_m3Wu2zKg-_Gj3NxeDhEQIXhuc8xvr/view?usp=sharing)\n\n6/2/22: All non-card images should now have alt text.

For a village of about 150 residents, it had sounded right. Like it would compliment a peaceful, downright idyllic place.  The weather, however, was the only thing that was as expected.\n\nThe population of the village seemed to have doubled that day, overrun with people who looked largely as if they were from anywhere but here.  Which, as it happened, was exactly where they had come from--all corners of the world and walks of life, coalescing bizarrely in the middle of nowhere. More of them than could be explained, even if the entire Abbey had come to greet the new members personally. While some disappeared down a rougher road, presumably leading to the Abbey still another half hour away, others came in to replace them.  One might suspect it was the first traffic jam in La Mal\u00e8ne caused by anything besides a recalcitrant sheep. Any one of the large vehicles could have caused a traffic jam almost anywhere though--bright colors and odd shapes of all textures hung off them, poking out of trucks and protective tarps.\n \nAnd yet, the villagers seemed nonplussed. They walked by the strangers as a New Yorker in Times Square might pass Elmo, the naked cowboy, or any mascot of the general strangeness of humanity.  Whatever was happening, as four perplexed travelers stretched hours and days on planes, trains and automobiles from their legs, one could only assume it had happened before.\n\nWandering across the square from the places their respective cabs had dropped them off, the travelers had only personal items and clothing with them, art supplies and heavy equipment having already been shipped ahead on the colony's dime.  One by one, the travelers spotted and drifted towards an odd group of three by a bench. Their transportation across the last miles to the Abbey, judging by the signs parodying a bored valet\u2019s, complete with names, or in Armand\u2019s case a picture of him lined in a long fringe of neon yarn with a bold, black print spelling out \u2018**THIS GUY**\u2019. \n\nDave and Yakov\u2019s joint sign wasn\u2019t quite as thoughtful--whoever had written it had started too far to the right and had to squish the rest of their names in too small spaces towards the end.  A stick figure waved apologetically below the messy writing.  Both of these priceless works were leaned against a sleeping man wearing a m\u00e9lange of bright colors, one covering his eyes to block light that might interrupt his nap, the other more prominently displayed where it had been propped up against him by the somewhat sulky figure of [a young black man](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a7/dd/97/a7dd97f8987fad1fc4305f2ca68ade9a.jpg) in faded jeans and paisley dress shirt. He wore three stacked party hats and was trying to hand a fourth to [a woman next to him](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PEavNDMIo7Y-gHgvSK-mLIH0gOjOjTJ7/view?usp=sharing).  \n\nFor her part, she wore a business suit, smoked with intense concentration, and ignored him. She also held Chi\u2019s sign-- certainly the most beautiful, dark, poetic sweeps of calligraphy making a graceful web of her name.\n\n*\u00b9Link to google map of La Malene location*"

Sweeping through Werault, it cut a wide, gruesome swath over hundreds of miles of ocean. When it hit the northwestern coast of the Territories, the population fled south and east, but the poison followed, thundering down the coast towards Freidan. The water was undrinkable. Food that grew from it was deadly.\n\nAs the toxin hit Thaler soil, the southerners not only assisted with food drops and supply convoys, they took in refugees from the north. The Alliance held, even as the kingdoms that had created it slowly died.\n\nSoon, the poison riddled the Northern Territories straight through to the opposite coast. Instead of merely fleeing to Thaler, many survivors rebelled against the crown and began a desperate, decentralized invasion of the southern lands. The fight only grew bloodier as Thaler rounded refugees up into internment compounds and fought back. The war and blight moved south, and Thaler was left as poisonous a shambles as the north. Communications from Territories dwindled until even the capital city of Spythra was silent, and Thaler followed suit. Freidan still stood. Well fortified and well stocked, it went relatively unmolested, the only bastion of hope spared by a dying world.\n\nFinally, one night, the moon failed to rise, and didn\u2019t reappear. A few weeks later, the water around Freidan began to clear of the poison. Hopes soared. Days after, the city fell.\n\n***\n\nIt should have ended in blood, should have taken months under siege for Freidan to fall. The starving dregs of Thaler and The North had already been skirmishing outside the city limits, even as they begged for supplies and equipment. There should have been someone to fight, one last battle with the possibility of a merciful victor.\n\nInstead it ended suddenly, in fire and ice, as if the earth had gone to war with the sky. Light and darkness clashed, day and night seeming to fall into a violent rage. First there was searing heat as the sun grew larger and brighter, appearing closer in the sky. Leaves withered, and birds in flight charred and fell. As the blazing temperatures intensified, many below died of heat stroke or immolation. Water boiled sporadically in the lakebeds.\n\nThick black clouds appeared, shedding bullets of hail that shattered on thick sheets of ice and hissed on hot pavement and roiling water. Steam poured over the city, capturing the deadly brilliance of the sunlight and the prongs of lightning, reflecting them in brief, mockingly beautiful rainbows like scattered opals.\n\nWithin hours, the chaos lifted as suddenly as it had fallen. The bitterly cold storms evaporated, and the sun shrank again. Death settled over the ruins.\n\n***\n\nIn the last surviving car of the last Solar Express subway train, dim red emergency lights guttered to life. There were only four passengers, but not an hour ago they had been treated to front row seats during Freidan\u2019s demise. Speeding through the city, darting into the open air at times to see the destruction, then back into in the relative shelter of tunnels below, they had been able to elude the deadly aboveground environment. Of course, the tunnels were only safe until the earth began to shake and crack open. The resulting crash had destroyed every car but the last, leaving its occupants in various states of collapse. \n\nAround them, the world was tinged red, illuminated by the back-up lighting of the damaged train car. Through the windows, a curiously intact stretch of very old tunnel could be seen, caved in on either side of the train car and  lined by large stone bricks covered in dingy peeling paint."

Bordered by the Glass Mountains to the north.  The capital of this kingdom was known as Spythra.\n \nThaler (The Southern Kingdom):  Warm, consisting of plains, a lot of farmland, and wastelands to the far south. Thaler controlled a lot of the food supply.  It had a powerful centralized government based in the capital city of Risan before everything went to hell.\n\nWerault (Underwater Civilization):  Werault wasn\u2019t exactly a kingdom, just what water dwellers call the inhabited ocean, the same way humans might say earth or world.  It\u2019s so big that no one that close to land has ever been to or even heard of the edge, just more underwater settlements farther and farther away.  The Weraulti people on the shoreline border had a lot of money and power due to their strategic position near the land.  They allied with land dwellers to keep them from polluting or over-fishing, and facilitate trade.  They often chose selkies as representatives, even sending them to land based schools in Freidan.\n\nFreidan: Formerly a central city created to facilitate international diplomacy, inhabitants came to Friedan from all over.  It had a mostly democratic government, mainly consisting of an international counsel made of representatives appointed by their homelands, and a \u201cRegent Elect\u201d to oversee its operation.  Great minds congregated there to learn and teach in relative freedom from international tensions.  Friedan was the most technologically advanced place in all the kingdoms.\n\nFairies:  No one knew where they came from or where they disappeared to, but sightings of the powerful and reclusive creatures petered out to almost nothing over the centuries until stopping entirely about 70 years ago. There was a small government funded effort to locate them, which soon disappeared from the news as budgets were cut.\n\n**PSA**: Submissions are coming in fast enough that I\u2019m going to make the cut off a little earlier than  I thought. Applications should be ready by **12:00 am EST, October 1st**. It\u2019s a bit less than the original week, but I think choosing characters is going to get overwhelming if I wait much longer.",

Mid 1800s.)*\n***\nThe End.\n\nIt came billowing poisonously through the seawater from some untraceable point in the ocean to the northwest, just beyond the Marchen Islands. Sweeping through Werault, it cut a wide, gruesome swath over hundreds of miles of ocean. When it hit the northwestern coast of the Territories, the population fled east, but the poison followed even as it thundered down the coast towards Freidan. The water was undrinkable. Food that grew from it was deadly.\n\nAs the toxin hit Thaler soil, the southerners not only assisted with food drops and supply convoys, they took in refugees from the north. The Alliance held, even as the kingdoms that had created it slowly died.\n\nSoon, the poison riddled the Northern Territories straight through to the opposite coast. Instead of fleeing to Thaler, many survivors rebelled against the crown and began a desperate, decentralized invasion of the southern lands. The fight only grew bloodier as Thaler rounded refugees up into internment compounds and fought back. The war and blight moved south, and Thaler was left as poisonous a shambles as the north. Communications from Territories dwindled until even the capital city of Spythra was silent, and Thaler followed suit. Freidan still stood. Well fortified and well stocked, it went relatively unmolested, the only bastion of hope spared by a dying world.\n\nFinally, one night, the moon failed to rise, and didn\u2019t reappear.   Days afterwards, the water around Freidan began to clear of the poison.  Hopes soared.  A week later, the city fell.\n\n***\n\nIt should have ended in blood, should have taken months under siege for Freidan to fall. The starving dregs of Thaler and The North had already been skirmishing outside the city limits, even as they begged for supplies and equipment. There should have been someone to fight, one last battle with the possibility of a merciful victor.\n\nInstead it had ended suddenly, in fire and ice, as if the earth had gone to war with the sky. Light and darkness clashed, day and night seeming to fall into a violent rage. It began with searing heat as the sun grew  larger and brighter, appearing closer in the sky. Leaves withered, and birds in flight charred and fell. As the heat intensified, many below died of heat stroke or immolation. Water boiled sporadically in the lakebeds. In the harbor, the bodies of ocean dwelling survivors from Werault washed ashore.\n\nThick black clouds appeared, shedding bullets of hail that shattered on thick sheets of ice and hissed on hot pavement and roiling water. Steam poured over the city, capturing the deadly brilliance of the sunlight and the prongs of lightening, reflecting them in brief, mockingly beautiful rainbows like scattered opals.\n\nWithin hours, the chaos lifted as suddenly as it had fallen. The bitterly cold  storms  evaporated, and the sun shrank again. Death settled over the ruins.\n\n***\n\nIn the last surviving car of the last Solar Express subway train, dim red emergency lights guttered to life. There were only three passengers, but not an hour ago they had been treated to front row seats during Freidan\u2019s demise. Speeding through the city, darting into the open air at times to see the destruction, then back into in the relative shelter of tunnels below, they had been able to elude the deadly aboveground environment. Of course, the tunnels were only safe until the earth began to shake and crack open. The resulting crash had destroyed every car but the last, leaving its occupants in various states of collapse.  One man slumped against a wall under a long curtain of black hair.  Another had been thrown to the floor, where a small bird fluttered dizzily beside him.   In the small booth meant for the handicapped and those with particularly delicate tails, wings, or other appendages, a young Harpy woman huddled, twined in safety straps.\n\nAround them, the world was tinged red, illuminated by the back-up lighting of the damaged train car. Through the windows, a curiously intact stretch of very old tunnel could be seen, lined by large stone bricks covered in dingy peeling paint."

I thought it was just going to a dead site with nothing going on, but it was actually really nice. The community is just amazing and the creativity and effort that goes into the game is amazing too.\n[xX_Del_Xx](https://storium.com/user/xx_del_xx)\n***\n\nI\u2019m still new to Storium, but already I can tell it\u2019s a great community on a great platform! The website is set up conveniently and the concept is genius!\n[CaptainParty](https://storium.com/user/captainparty)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve been on Storium for a little over two months now, but I\u2019ve already met some amazing people. I really enjoy the collaborative aspect of Storium and how one person can start with one idea, but after playing a game with others, it can branch off into a totally different, even better direction! I think that\u2019s amazing, and it brings the game back to its roots, writing with other people.\n[Latte1](https://storium.com/user/latte1)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve been on storium just a bit over one year and joined as a way to improve my writing and connected with other skilled writers which has been a rather success in that way. It forces me to improvise and improve as I learn to work with other people\u2019s style and write from different perspectives.\n[Jaspericorn](https://storium.com/user/jaspericorn)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve been on Storium for only a little while now but I\u2019ve already found myself welcomed by such an excellent and creative community and I feel that it\u2019s really inspired me to improve my writing! It\u2019s also been a way for me to connect with other authors and learn about different writing styles while having fun and making both stories and friends.\n[sleepyrune](https://storium.com/user/sleepyrune)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve been on Storium for only a short while but I love it. It\u2019s filled with wonderful people and gives me the freedom, creativity, and a site to express myself. I have been looking for a place to improve my writing for a while and I found it here! Hope I win the raffle, this seems fun :D\n[BlazeTheMonkey](https://storium.com/user/blazethemonkey)\n***\n\nStorium narrators challenge me to research futuristic technologies and historical anecdotes to include in my character posts. It takes a great deal of real-world knowledge to write good fiction.\n[Wyldspace](https://storium.com/user/wyldspace)\n***\n\nAw, this is such a sweet idea! I hopped onto Storium a month ago and was absolutely inspired by the fascinating meld of writing and game mechanics, and even more so inspired by the creative ways narrators and players have utilized that system to create interesting, fun stories and games (and newsletters! And raffles!). Already within my first games I met people who were so incredibly kind and encouraging, and really met that social need I was craving during this time in history. I\u2019m excited to see where my journey here takes me. Happy holidays!\n[Thewillowstorm](https://storium.com/user/thewillowstorm)\n***\n\nPlaying on Storium has given me the opportunity to not only have players explore my world, but to explore other player\u2019s stories as well, and see their worlds. I\u2019ve participated in games in genres I\u2019d never have thought I\u2019d have tried otherwise, and it\u2019s helped me grow as a writer.\n[CraftmasterMatt](https://storium.com/user/craftmastermatt)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve been on storium for just a few months now, but one thing I instantly adored about the platform was its simplicity . It\u2019s been so easy to browse games, look for help, and communicate/collaborate with other players in the games since the moment I started. Storium really has changed the entire collaborative writing experience for me.\n[Layz](https://storium.com/user/layz)\n\n***\nYou know what makes me jump on and play around in Storium?\n\nTHIS\n\nPeople like you mate who are all about bringing communities together and giving back to those who helped and supported you.\n\nI have been on Storium since August, when a really dark and bad time of my life erupted and tried to take hold. (I am not going to bore or going into it)\n\nBut since being on here I have since found the Light and a sense of community that is strong in its support for one another and strengthens each other in a way that society tends to frown on in this current social climate.\n\nStorium has helped me fight back my darkness, and for that I am ever truly grateful for not only the people here, but also the creators of this place.\n\nThankyou all.\n[NeverWolf](https://storium.com/user/neverwolf)\n***\n\nI found Storium while looking for a game with a story or a game for an author who doesn\u2019t want to be shoved into a box of hit bad guy, move on to next bad guy. When I saw this site, I ignored it for a hot minute because it sounded to good to be true. I finally gave in to clicking, and I\u2019m so glad I did. After finding a wonderfully inviting community and a roleplay style that encourages me to come out of my comfort zone, I won\u2019t even think about leaving anytime soon.\n\nBest of luck to everyone!\n[FireFoxTale](https://storium.com/user/firefoxtale)\n***\n\nI\u2019ve always loved writing and making up stories and characters. One of my favourite childhood games was where the whole family passed around a story prompt, building upon it until we have an epic adventure!\n\nI\u2019ve searched around for \u201ccollaborative writing games\u201d for a long time and it was only a few months back that I chanced upon Storium.\n\nI\u2019ve met a whole bunch of awesome creative writers and been exploring a whole new side to my writing skills! I have definitely grown in confidence to step out of my comfort zone in writing! So far I\u2019ve loved the experience!\n[Kyoko](https://storium.com/user/kyoko)\n***\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how I stumbled upon Storium, but I wonder now how I ever got along without it. I, of course, joined as a member from day one because I couldn\u2019t get enough. I hope to be a part of this community for years to come. / Everyone is really nice and supportive. The stories are amazing and I feel right at home. Sometimes we all need a place to escape to a different reality and for me, that has become Storium (and my Stephen King books)\n[Drucellia](https://storium.com/user/drucellia)\n***\n\nStorium is a gem; the community here is just incredible and, like Layz said, the brutal simplicity of this website is just golden. I\u2019ve been addicted the moment i made an account. Thanks for coming up with this idea, @stlhood.\n[PeetTheSockMan](https://storium.com/user/peetthesockman)\n***\n\nNot entering, as I\u2019m not going to use all of it due to the fact that I\u2019m taking a break from Storium around May\u2026 just getting in on the fun! :D\nI found Storium after using StoriumEDU with my friends, and I immediately started to love it. I loved the community element of it, and the fact that you could start any story on here and bring others into your world. The game elements just brings the writing out to a whole new level, and adds a very interesting element to the story. There are so many different ideas, and so many amazing writers and people on this site.\n[Blackmoon](https://storium.com/user/blackmoon)\n***\n\nHello! I found Storium just a few days ago and it\u2019s proven to be an incredible place for me to regain my writing muse and to meet other people who are passionate about writing as well!\n\nI, unfortunately, cannot afford a membership for Storium so I\u2019m jumping on this opportunity to hopefully be one of the winners.\n\nThank you for both of your generosities and I hope you both have an amazing holiday season! :)\n[Galaxtia](https://storium.com/user/galaxtia)\n***\n\nHey! I\u2019ve been on Storium for a while now, and I absolutely love it. I find amazing people, who are GREAT writers, and even better friends. There\u2019s hardly any drama, unless it\u2019s in the stories. I love the teamwork people work in!\n \nI cannot afford a Storium membership, so I\u2019m hoping that I might be one of the winners.\n\u2764\ufe0f Happy Holidays! :D\n[Aubrey11](https://storium.com/user/aubrey11)\n***\n\nHello - not entering but lurking :)\nAnd what makes me play storium? I love the mix of games - from the literature end to the pulpy RP end and all the way in between. But\u2026 the big draw is the people - storium has such a fantastic, diverse group of players :)\n[Ssieth](https://storium.com/user/ssieth)"
