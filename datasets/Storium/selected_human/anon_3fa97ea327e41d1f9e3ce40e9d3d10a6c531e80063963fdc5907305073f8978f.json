Of course, archaeology was never tidy, academia was never uncontentious, and nothing that involved so many people happened without *some* tears and headaches.  But all things considered, it had gone well; the head of logistics had only threatened to resign twice.\n\nThen the disappearances had started.\n\nTo begin with, it was no more than anyone might expect; the number of people on any dig who fled back to town on discovering how much _work_ archaeology involved was frequently staggering.  The fog of suspicion and rumour was unsurprising, too, as the trenches uncovered secrets from a time of legend, and even scholars could have too much imagination.\n\nAt some point, though, everyone had to accept that there might be more to it than fanciful tales from bored students or twitchy porters. That came when a grizzled veteran of the Tahellan Warmasters\u2019 Guild limped into camp, barely upright, gasping and bleeding.\n\n\u201cDemons!\u201d\n\nBael Sivornin had spent twenty years fighting beasts and men across the realms. He was no wet behind the ears greenhorn who might mistake a jungle creature for a fiend. If he said that there were demons, the expedition leaders would have to consider the idea.\n\n---\n\nTwenty minutes later, the scene in the central camp was less a meeting than a cacophony.\n\n\"Well, no one _knows_ how Val'Raz fell\u2014\u201d\n\n\"But _demons_, really, how fanciful.  Bandits, now that I could believe...\"\n\nAn arcanist who went by the name of Ash grimaced to hear the talk.  His long forked tail lashed out, disturbing several of his rivals' papers.  Rumour said that his mother's mother was a demon from the Infernal Planes, so it was no wonder that he didn't like this line of talk.\n\n\"Typical, isn't it?  The minute you can't explain something, it must have been _demons_.\"\n\n\u201cEveryone, please, this isn\u2019t helping.\u201d\n\nNo one paid any attention to the efforts of the senior mage-scholar to bring the meeting to order until the Martial Commander slammed her blue steel-edged shield into the floor.\n\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d\n\nIrian Shildrath had the fierce nature and commanding presence common to clerics of the forge-god Sil Marne. She spoke, and suddenly everyone was quiet and respectful, glaring at their neighbours as if _other people_ had been causing the trouble, not them.\n\n\u201cThank you, Lady Shildrath.\u201d She nodded, and took a step back, leaving the floor to the chief archaeologist, Najib Akhiran, who looked as if he would rather be anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to figure out what has happened.\u201d A few people seemed inclined to start whispering again, but a glare from Irian changed their minds. \u201cBael is unconscious, so we can\u2019t question him now, and we can\u2019t afford to wait for him to wake up. He came from the Eastern Excavation, so I plan to send a party there to investigate.\u201d\n\nNajib looked around the room, but almost everyone avoided his eyes. More in hope than in expectation, he asked: \u201cDoes anybody want to volunteer?\u201d"

Uniformed security staff directed passengers down the corridors towards the heart of the ship, keeping the steady influx from turning into a crush.\n\n\"Greetings, est\u2014\u201d\n\n\"The 0920 shuttle from Cocoa Beach is now disembarking.  Please follow the instructions of our security and hospitality staff as you board the *Symphonia*.  Thank you.\"\n\nOnly the stragglers remained from the 0905 Cayenne shuttle, and the new arrivals had been stopped for the final security screening before boarding.  A dark-haired white woman, her age probably somewhere around forty, stood watching the proceedings in quiet approval.  She was trying to project an air of military competence, but her attitude and bearing told a different story; to those who knew what to look for she was all too obviously ex-police.\n\nHer eyes followed one passenger in particular, but she made no move to intercept him.\n\n\"Greetings, esteemed guest.\"\n\nPassengers continued to flow onto the ship, and the first of the Cocoa Beach arrivals reached the gate.  The security staff shepherded them into the correct sectors and, as they walked, their devices downloaded information about the gala reception in a few hours.\n\nUntil then, they were at liberty to do as they pleased.\n\n---\n\nTwo corridors converged and flowed forwards as one, the closely-spaced doors on either side marking it as an accommodation area.  Nearest the corner were two single cabins, smaller but more private.  One of the doors was open just enough to show a flash of green within.\n\nThe usher, a petite and androgynous person in a crisp new uniform, stepped forward to show the ticket holder down the hall to the indicated cabin.  They demonstrated the biometric entry system\u2014as if anyone on Earth might *not* know how one worked\u2014and swung the door open to reveal the room beyond.  It was somehow exactly as described in the recruitment literature yet also vaguely disappointing.  Even a \"virtual tour\" could tell a lie, apparently.\n\n\"If you need anything while you're settling in, come and find me.  I'll be in the corridor.\"\n\nThe door closed behind them, leaving the passenger alone.  \n\nIt was the *size*, really.  The carefully crafted words and well-chosen camera angles had somehow, probably deliberately, managed to conceal that.  Another bed, as yet empty and unclaimed, stood as a reminder that a *second* person would be sharing this too-tight space.\n\nAt least there was no noise from down the hall.  Whether that was due to clever soundproofing or simply an absence of other guests remained to be seen, but it was promising.\n\nStill, it hardly mattered.  They were aboard the ship now.  Their adventure had begun.\n\n---\n\n*More challenges will be added as the scene progresses.  For now, though you can make as many moves as you like, you should play only one card on one of the challenges.*\n\n*The **Strange(r) Bedfellows** and **Unexpected Situation** challenges are for PC-PC interaction, with one card from each player.  For an Uncertain outcome, the players get to decide what the result of their interaction looks like.  The **Settle In** challenge outcome depends only on the card you play, though you may involve NPCs and even other PCs (with permission) in your move if you want.*"

Perhaps it had been a cold, indifferent, lifeless beauty, the kind that only an astronomer could truly appreciate, but even so, it was long gone now.  It had started with the discovery of rare minerals in the asteroid fields, intensified as the mining of gas giants swung back into vogue, and now the ruin was complete.  Pelagius was littered with makeshift tin-can orbital stations, barely equipped to handle mining, commerce, science, and all of the necessities of modern life.\n\nOf these floating bases or 'outposts', the largest and most prominent was Heraklion.  When interstellar freighters made it to Pelagius, most of them docked here, so it was the best place to go if you had something to sell, or needed anything the system couldn't provide.\n\nIt also housed _The Daggers Drawn_, the best-known merc bar in Pelagius.  If you needed to hire someone who at least probably wasn't a pirate, there was nowhere better.  There was nothing so crude as a \"job board\"; fixers and agents set up meetings in a discreet location, and sometimes friends ran into one another and exchanged details.  Couriers, smugglers, salvage crews, even a few bounty-hunters: all could be found here if you knew who to ask.\n\nIf you believed what _he_ had to say, Garim Larius knew everyone of importance in the whole system.  He preferred to employ people who'd worked for him before, which had inspired \"that damn wrench jockey Malinowski\" to ask how anyone got a _first_ chance.  Larius had glowered at her, but as luck would have it, he'd had a \"little job\" on his books just then...\n\nThe rest, as a biographer might say, was history.  He wasn't their most regular _or_ their most lucrative employer, but if he had something for them, it was usually worth a look.\n\n\"It ain't much of a job.\"\n\nThey recognised this opening gambit for what it was: an attempt to keep the price down.  If he didn't need them to do this, he wouldn't have asked.  No one paid for nothing out here.\n\n\"Let us be the judge of that.\"\n\n\"That's probably best, yeah.\"  Larius shot a sideways glance at his only companion, a quietly menacing woman he called Rigger.  Whether it was her name, a nickname, a title, or just one of Larius's jokes, no one knew for sure.  Nor was it clear what her position was; some claimed she was a simple bodyguard, others that she was the brains of the operation.\n\nThe truth probably lay somewhere between the two, but wild speculation was more fun.\n\nAs was her habit, she didn't say anything in reply; very few of Larius's business associates ever heard her speak.  But she _did_ raise her eyes eloquently to the ceiling as he turned away.\n\n\"Alright, so, it's a salvage job, as I'm sure you could've worked out without me saying it.  There's a cargo\u2014or part of a cargo, anyway\u2014spread across the Rivera Belt, a few hours from here as you head towards Shackleton.  I got a client who wants it back, but either they can't be assed to get it, or they'd have to fill too many forms to do it the legit way.\"\n\nThis was far from uncommon; besides the reasons Larius had offered, there was also a lot less chance of any higher-ups finding out what had happened if you hired mercenaries.\n\n\"So it's just a standard tractor beam job.  Got any questions?\""

It was one of the constant truths of life on the island: the ferry would always be late.\n\nJust before they might have given up for the night, it arrived; a small flat-bottomed boat, piloted by a boatman who was heavily muffled against the cool and unpleasantly damp evening air.  A shroud of fog hung over the water, transformed into a sickly, fire-covered curtain as the light of the setting sun filtered through.\n\nEven before they set off, the omens were there.  Perhaps it would have been better for them to turn away, to abandon the idea of coming back to Draythel at all.\n\nNo good ever came of ignoring omens.\n\nThe next clue that something\u2014or everything\u2014would go wrong came when they drew close enough to the docks at Draythel to see that there were no lamps lit.  Worse, as the ferry bobbed through the last few feet, they could see that there was no one on the dockside at all.  True, it was an unpleasant evening, but that would not have stopped *everyone* from leaving their homes.  There ought to have been someone there.\n\nAs they stepped out of the boat, the creaking of the aged wooden jetty was all they could hear.  The only sound for what seemed like miles around.

And, whatever the truth of this proverb in general, it was surely in the minds of the people of Ain-Qisam that evening, when they saw the motley collection of outsiders stumble into their little town.\n  \nJudging from appearances, these strange folk were adventurers, which in the desert usually meant treasure hunters.  Or perhaps grave robbers--though to the Ishkarim this was less an act of desecration and more an inevitable fact of life.  Camels spat, sand stung your eyes, jackals looted tombs.  In these more enlightened days they burned their dead anyway.\n\nSo no one in Ain-Qisam paid much attention to the visitors, save to note that some were foreigners while others were not.  The large golem that travelled with them raised a few eyebrows\u2014but, after all, the art of golemancy was not unknown or even very obscure.  According to some of the better-educated townsfolk, it was a particularly impressive specimen, but even that was not sufficient to distract them from their own concerns.\n\nTheir indifference did not last for long, however, once they had learned *why* this particular band of treasure hunters had come to their town.\n\nFevered conversation gripped the marketplace as the locals packed away their wares:\n\n\"The Lost City?  Are you deaf or are they insane?\"\n\n\"My ears are as good as ever they were, thank you.  But yes, they seek the Lost City.\"  A shrug, careless and dismissive.  \"It is not the first time.  It will not be the last.  People will seek after anything that is lost.\"\n\n\"How else are things to be found?\"  This from Jinan, the town's lone Priest of Naukar, whose opinion on such things was both predictable and hopelessly biased.\n\n\"The Lost City is lost by the will of the gods.  Why do these fools believe they can find it?\"\n\n\"The will of the gods?\"  A snort.  \"No; it was *men* who decreed the city should be lost.  Though I will not say that they were wrong, for it was a place of wickedness and greed.\"\n\n\"Did you see?  The man is one of *them*.  Who knows what *they* might seek there?\"\n\n\"The treasures of his ancestors?\"  The speaker let out a hoarse guffaw.  \"Don't be a fool.\"\n\nSome more pragmatic soul spoke next.  \"They have a map, I believe.\"\n\n\"A map!\"  This was greeted with some scorn.  \"Anyone could draw such a thing, to profit from ignorant foreigners.  *I* could have done so.\"\n\n\"And have done in the past, I would imagine.\"  This speaker was a young woman, clad in light chainmail, a shamshir at her belt.  \"Well.  Perhaps they know the true path.  Perhaps not.  If you will excuse me, *sudiqan*, I would see these travellers and their map for myself.\"\n\n---\n\nIn the meantime, the subjects of this conversation had settled in the public room of Ain-Qisam's caravanserai.  Refreshments had been ordered, and they were now sampling the local delicacies, including what passed for beer in this part of the world.  It was a strange brew, thick and sweet, almost a gruel in its unfiltered state--but for all that it was not unpleasant, and even those who were unfamiliar with it seemed to like it well enough.\n\n(Atru, of course, could not drink it at all, though perhaps he wished he could.)\n\nIn any case, they each had more important things with which to occupy their minds; food and drink ranked a poor second to the task ahead of them.  Ain-Qisam was the last marker on their map that could be called at all civilised.  When they left on the morrow, they were to strike south and east across untracked lands, at the mercy of the merciless desert."

No one knew what to make of it, not until a survivor limped back to camp.\n\nHe spoke one word and then collapsed.  \"Demons!\"",

        "comment": "Deep in the jungles of Tahella lurk the ruins of countless lost civilisations.  Or so the stories say, and there is enough truth in them to support dozens of archaeological expeditions.  But there was always one dream that seemed to be impossible: the Floating City of Val'Raz.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe scouts who uncovered the site noted that the shattered stone and cracked columns had no foundations in the earth beneath them.  It was as if they'd fallen from a great height.\n\nIf it was Val'Raz, that was true, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nPeople came from far and wide to join the expedition: to help or to argue, to guard or to marvel at the wonder of it.  In truth, there was very little to see, except a litter of broken stones strewn across the jungle floor, but imagination is a powerful thing.\n\n---\n\nNo one with any experience of large-scale expeditions was surprised by the fog of rumour and superstition surrounding the ruins, especially after the first few disappearances.  Those weren't unexpected either; the number of people who fled back to town upon realising how much _work_ was involved in archaeology was truly staggering.\n\nAt some point, though, everyone had to accept that there might be more to it than bored students and the fancy of twitchy porters.  That point came when a grizzled veteran of the Tahellan Warmasters' Guild limped into camp, barely upright, gasping and bleeding.\n\n\"Demons!\"\n\nBael Sivornin had spent twenty years fighting beasts and men on battlefields across the land.  He was no wet behind the ears greenhorn to mistake a jungle creature for a fiend.  If he said that there were demons, the expedition leaders would have to consider the idea.\n\n---\n\nThe scene in the central camp was less a meeting and more a cacophony.\n\n\"Well, no one _knows_ how Val'Raz fell\u2014\u201d\n\n\"But _demons_, really, how fanciful...\"\n\nOne of the arcanists, who went by the improbable name of Joy-in-Ashes, grimaced at this, lashing out with his long forked tail and disturbing several of his rivals' papers.  His mother's mother, so the gossip went, was a demon from the Infernal Plane of Fire.  So it was little wonder that he didn't like the current talk, or that his colleagues eyed him uneasily.\n\n\"Typical, isn't it, the minute you can't explain something, it must have been _demons_ that did it.\"  His voice was quiet, but it hissed and crackled like dormant embers.\n\n\"Everyone, please, this isn't helping.\"\n\nNo one paid any attention to the efforts of the senior mage-scholar to bring the meeting to order until the Martial Commander slammed her blue steel-edged shield into the floor.\n\n\"Quiet!\"\n\nIrian Shildrath had the fierce nature and commanding presence common to clerics of the forge-god Sil Marne.  She spoke, and suddenly everyone was quiet and respectful, glaring at their neighbours as if _other people_ had been causing the trouble, not them.\n\n\"Thank you, Lady Irian.\"  She nodded, and took a step back, leaving the floor to the chief archaeologist, Nevyz Akhiran, who looked as if he would rather be anywhere else.\n\n\"The most important thing is to figure out what has happened.\"  A few people seemed inclined to start whispering again, but a glare from Irian changed their minds.  \"Bael is unconscious, so we can't question him now, and we can't afford to wait for him to wake.  He came from the Eastern Excavation, so I plan to send a party there to investigate.\"\n\nNevyz looked around the room, but almost everyone avoided his eyes.  More in hope than in expectation, he asked: \"Does anybody want to volunteer?\"\n\n---\n\n>_**Tutorial Notes:**_\n>&nbsp;\n>_For this challenge, everyone will play their **Subplot** card and make a move to show why their character agrees to investigate.  Because Subplots are neutral cards, this means that the challenge will finish **uncertain**, and no one has to worry about writing an outcome just yet._"

        "comment": "How long would it take you to notice that your only child had gone missing?\n\nIt took Aryn Sunderling fifteen hours.  His daughter, Lydia - bright, brash and just seventeen - was given to wandering the countryside at all hours of the day, so when she failed to show up for the morning meal, he thought nothing of it.  He was a busy man with students to oversee, and had little energy to expend on worrying about what small mischiefs Lydia might have managed to get into.  The girl could handle herself.  She *was* his daughter, after all.\n\nThen the midday meal came and went, with Lydia still nowhere to be found - and that was when Aryn began to worry.\n\nWhen he went to look in her bedroom - something that, without such a cause, he would never have ventured to do - he found a long, silly letter detailing his daughter's plans to search for a legendary weapon.  Her plans to become a great hero.  Her plans to get herself embroiled in the war that was possibly brewing between Atalera and Vidaris, miles to the south.  And *that* was when Aryn sent out a call for professional help.\n\nThere were always adventurers passing through Eastholt.  It was a well-supplied minor trading post that provided a good deal of goods and services interesting to those of an itinerant persuasion - and for those who fancied themselves as warriors, there was Aryn's school.  Many of the local adventuring fighters had trained there at some point or other, and it was generally considered good form to offer to spar the current students when passing through.\n\nAnd so, when Aryn Sanderling put out a call for adventurers, it took hardly any time at all for five likely candidates to be gathered in front of him.  The weapons master looked at the composition of the little group, and wisely threw out any parts of his planned speech that centred around the flightiness of young women.\n\n\"Thank you for turning out at such short notice,\" he said, as he paced before them.  \"I assume you have already heard the reason for my call - but in case you have not, my daughter Lydia has run away.  She left a letter behind, in which she outlines her intention to find a weapon of legend and end the potential war with Vidaris before it can start.\"  He shook his head.  \"Which would be worrying enough, even had I not found a copy of this book under her pillow.\"\n\nHe handed the book to the nearest adventurer, who took a look at the title page, blanched and passed it on.  As far as potentially harmful fantasy masquerading as history went, it was hard to do better - or worse - than *Sword of Destiny: The Truth Behind the Legend of the Sword of Souls*.  And it was hard to think of a worse legendary weapon for a naive young person to seek in innocence. \n\n\"You will no doubt understand why I put out such an urgent call.\"  Aryn said, his voice dry, his face pained.\n\nOf course they did.  How could they not?\n\n\"Warden only knows how she set hands on that book, but at least it tells us what she is seeking and where she will be going.\"  He grimaced.  \"The *fiction* between these covers espouses the popular opinion that the Sword was lost in the Birchmere when the invader Riach was slain and his armies driven back to Vidaris.  So that is where she would go, at least at first.\"\n\nIt would be a long journey, especially on foot.  They could hope to catch Lydia on the road long before then - but the girl had been gone for hours now.  Their best hope might be to travel with all haste to Barrowdene, forty miles and more to the south, and hope to pick up news there.\n\n\"One more thing,\" Aryn said, his eyes as hard and cold as flints.  \"One of the Eastholt Guard saw her leave, but was... *persuaded* not to report it.  He is presently in the stocks.\"  Barely-restrained violent anger tightened the weapons master's face, reminding all present that, middle-aged or not, there were still few who could best Aryn Sunderling in a fight.  \"I don't know what good questioning him might do you, but perhaps you wish to throw something at him before you leave.\"\n\nSuddenly his faced softened, and in a much more gentle voice - the voice of a worry-stricken father - he said, \"I... there is no way for me to thank you enough for what you are doing for me - and for Lydia.  This is a truly noble thing that you do.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.\""
