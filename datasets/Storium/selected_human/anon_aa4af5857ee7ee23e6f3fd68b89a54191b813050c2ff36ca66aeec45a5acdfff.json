Gone is the need for brooding heroes riding off into the horizon, or bloodthirsty barbarians with strong sword arms and loose morals, or contemplative mages challenging the very boundaries of reality. \n\nNo, now the world's nations have a much stronger need for mid-level managers, bureaucrats, efficiency experts, and rank-and-file laborers. And if you've got a talent for magic, well, expect to have that put to a constructive use, with absolutely *no* unsanctioned personal experiments! (We don't want another accidental necromantic army this harvest, *thankyouverymuch*).\n\nBut the Guild's still around, and it hasn't quite lost its romantic memory. Young, talented would-be heroes still sign up--some via the correspondence course--and get their shiny Adventuring License, allowing them to trek off to help the needy (if their filings with the local guard have come to naught), delve forbidden dungeons (which are often condemned for a good reason), and exterminate dangerous monsters (unless they're endangered species).\n\n...It's hard having an Adventuring License these days.",

        "comment": "\u201cBut why do we have to meet in a tavern?\u201d Mungo asked. \u201cWhy *this* tavern?\u201d\n\n\nThey\u2019d known him two minutes and it was already understood that this whining had to be cut off immediately, lest it devolve into an hour long treatise on why this was the worst transgression in modern historical record.\n\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re proper adventurers, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Mara said, pointing at the parchment of guild bylaws she kept on hand. \u201cI mean if we don\u2019t want to be *real* adventurers I guess we can do whatever, but we\u2019re *supposed* to start in a tavern. Those are the rules. That\u2019s what makes this a guild-sanctioned mission.\u201d\n\n\nMungo was unconvinced, groaning--well, dramatically. \u201cBut why *this* tavern?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s closest to where we\u2019re supposed to go.\u201d Pram looked flustered and annoyed. \u201cWhy are we still talking? Let\u2019s just get going--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s *tradition,*\u201d said Dave--or Orokn, if you ignored his paperwork (alas, his processing had been done under Dave Waterson and between the fee to refile and the time delay, well\u2026 the Temple had been *very* encouraging of Orokn to \u2018get out there and make Gruumsh proud!\u2019). He thumped his mug on the table for good measure.\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Mungo\u2019s face twisted in disdain. \u201c...*skellies.*\u201d\n\n\nAnd indeed, across the room, a small cluster of \u2018living skeletons\u2019--the sort who had somehow magically obtained self-awareness and autonomy--were congregated around a table, speaking to each other and gesturing with mugs. Which was pretty weird when to respected the fact that skeletons didn\u2019t eat or drink. But after a barkeep over in Harkon Mills had lost his establishment over a lawsuit, everybody was willing to let them dump alcohol down their rib cages, onto the floor, and just have someone clean-up the mess later. \n\n\nIf they wanted to pretend to have functioning digestive systems, so be it.\n\n\nMungo glared at them. Sneered. Scowled over another sip of drink.\n\n\nPram was exasperated. \u201cOf course there are skeletons here. *That\u2019s the mission.* You all remember why we\u2019re here, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLoot,\u201d grumbled Orokn.\n\n\n\u201cStuff,\u201d Mara added.\n\n\n\u201c...okay, yes, I\u2019m also here for money *sort of,*\u201d Pram acknowledged. \u201cBut the Old Crypt Gang are out here terrorizing this place and we\u2019re supposed to get them to stop, so\u2026\u201d\n\n\nMungo glowered. \u201cThis is what you *city people* get for keeping all your dead rounded up in some cozy building so one day some two-bit necromancer can just *waltz in* and raise an army. If you disposed of remains properly this would never happen!\u201d\n\n\nThe other three quietly ignored the well-documented existence of incorporeal undead.\n\n\n\u201cAaanyway, so we\u2019re here to deal with the OCG and whatever\u2019s put them up to this mess and help the townspeople\u2026 stop being terrorized. I guess.\u201d \n\n\nMara looked over the guild mission notice. \u201cThere\u2019s, um\u2026 not a whole lot on here in the way of background, is there?\u201d\n\n\nOrokn leaned over. \u201cLet me see that.\u201d\n\n\nMara pulled away but didn\u2019t acknowledge the maneuver. \u201cI guess we should figure out what\u2019s going on, yup. Do the job. Root out the bad skeletons.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd stay out of jail,\u201d Pram offered. \u201cThey *do* have citizenship.\u201d\n\nMungo groaned and threw back his head. \u201cWhy is everything so haaaard?\u201d\n\nNobody had an answer for that. They did, however, have another round of drinks."

        "comment": "It was raining when they buried Nick, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a day in Belgaerd when it wasn\u2019t raining. You got used to it\u2014or you didn\u2019t, and you went crazy. It was an easy town to go crazy in; to go crazy for. Detective Nick L. Dime found that out in the moments before he died. In the moments after he did what every person hopes they\u2019d do, given a similarly piss poor hand of cards.\n\nJorgin was gonna miss the kid.\n\nThe gruff, old dwarf had high hopes for him, back when they met. Young, but smart, with a good nose for sussing out the whys and wherefores, and a keen mind for the magic. Too good, as it turned out. He\u2019d have made a damn fine detective, words Jorgin was glad he could offer to his folks in complete honesty. Kid even managed to close that first case. Just a shame that it closed him, too.\n\nYeah, he\u2019d miss him, but it wasn\u2019t the first partner Jorgin had buried. Not likely to be the last, either. Belgaerd had no end to her appetite, would happily grind up and swallow the next sucker offered up to her, like some kind of chthonic goddess gobbling up sacrificial lambs with wanton abandon. In fact, that was probably a more apt description than he\u2019d care to admit. \n\nIt was a hungry city, alright; and a city of hunger. Want, want, want.\n\nRight now, Jorgin wanted a drink. Belgaerd never quite went full prohibition, like her neighbors, but there were limits on the kind of elixir he could partake of. He had a thirst for the real hard stuff at the moment, and he had a flask of it waiting for him in his pocket. Almost didn\u2019t care who saw; almost did it just to see if he could start a fight out of it. But no, kid\u2019s folks were still here, kid\u2019s sister still bawling up a storm to rival gloomy clouds overhead.\n\nHe turned to leave, but found his way blocked by Bart.\n\nSergeant Bartholomew Dunn was the only person in the City Guard more curmudgeonly and disagreeable than Jorgin. Also the only one as experienced. The satyr had been doing this work since there was work to be done, and had approximately as positive an outlook on it as Jorgin. As a result, they tended to get along spectacularly, grumbling and complaining about the same dragon-sized piles of crap set before them. Bart probably should\u2019ve been Captain of the Guard a couple decades ago, but\u2014as the jokes goes\u2014nobody on the City Council could stand the clacking of his hooves on marble floors. So instead, Bart got all the rough cases.\n\nWhich meant Jorgin got all the roughest of the rough.\n\nRight now, Bart had that look on his face that meant Jorgin wasn\u2019t going to get that drink. Not just yet, anyway.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked.\n\nBart didn\u2019t answer right away. He stamped the ground and fiddled with his ludicrously long goatee, staring out over the end of Nick\u2019s funerary proceedings. Satyrs grew beards like billy goats, but it was terrible idea to poke fun of it. \u201cThis one got to you,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t stated as a question, so Jorgin didn\u2019t answer. Not until Bart fixed him with a steady, steely stare. \u201cIf you need time off, you can have it. You\u2019re due.\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re always hexing due.\u201d"

        "post_title": "Our world is not our own anymore. \n\nIn 2015, aliens arrived\u2013a multi-species, militaristic force with unimaginably advanced technology. They created bioengineering monstrosities, had mastered interstellar and atmospheric flight-capable aircraft, and could even reach out mind-to-mind and control their enemies. Earth never stood a chance, though we still fought.\n\nAt first, they toyed with us; we still don\u2019t know why. They conducted a shadow war in small strikes, prodding and poking us as though to see what would happen. Eventually, though, they came in force, and one by one they demanded the surrender of our nations. The first to surrender created the \u2018ADVENT Coalition\u2019, which laughably pretended to govern *with* the aliens, as partners. We all knew better. \n\nOpen warfare was swift and brutal. They bombed our cities with a toxic fog that rendered them unlivable, leaving anyone caught within to devolve into a nightmarish echo of their own humanity, forcing the rest of us to flee to the open countryside. Scattered, without our satellites, without anywhere to concentrate our forces, it was only a matter of time.\n\nThey decided to stay. Under the ADVENT Coalition, they rebuilt the cities that they cared to in their own design, to their own sensibilities, stripping them of human culture and tradition. There, humans are kept like favored pets: cared for, nourished, but never let off leash. They control information, health, food, and of course all armed forces.\n\nHowever, their control is not complete. Outside the cities, the aliens don\u2019t seem to care much what the rest of us do. We eke out a life however we can, struggling day-to-day, and perhaps they think that means they can ignore us.\n\nThey have always underestimated us.\n\nMore and more of us are answering the call to resist. We don\u2019t have much to turn against them, but we find ways: by learning where supplies are kept, when transports are running, who their important personnel are, and where our own prisoners have been taken. We gather this precious information, and we disseminate it to anyone with the means and will to fight back; anyone willing to try and hobble their horrific machine.\n\nThey control the planet, but they don\u2019t yet control us, and as long as there are still people able to fight, we\u2019ll support them. No matter the cost.\n\n---\n\nThis is one of three [parallel](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-twilight-kingdom/) [stories](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-violent-souls/) that act as a sequel to [XCOM: Falls the Shadow](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/). This story focuses on the survivor communities that comprise the non-combat Resistance to the ADVENT coalition government. They live a hard life in the dangerous wilds outside ADVENT\u2019s control, struggling day-to-day between basic survival, dodging ADVENT patrols and crackdowns, maintaining human culture, and supporting the ongoing fight to be free. \n",

[Where would you go?](https://open.spotify.com/track/5vk0wH7SBvgagIPOEmMSHr)\u201d*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt started slowly, at first: a UFO sighting here, a blurry photo of a creature never before seen on earth over there, and scattered reports of clandestine strike teams arriving to quickly suppress and clean up strange anomalies\u2013like Men in Black if they had a SEAL Team Six. It seemed so preposterous, so impossible, that it was easy to dismiss, even with the evidence accumulating by the day. Our own culture had trained us to do it, after all.\r\n\r\nSoon enough, though, it was impossible to ignore: the abductions, the attacks on cities, the steadily accumulating footage of monstrous creatures and advanced weaponry discharged in public, the *spaceships*. Humanity had finally made contact with aliens, and they were *not* friendly.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of fear in those days, when so little was known. The aliens would make a move, an attack, and humanity could only *respond,* and that response was inevitably XCOM; everyone knew the name eventually, and realized as well that the United Nations had devised this program in secret decades ago, had been *expecting* this\u2013and had kept it quiet as long as they could. Humanity\u2019s defenders were unknown, unelected, and unaccountable. Our fate was out of our hands.\r\n\r\nAnd humanity was clearly outmatched, though it would still be months before the aliens decided to leverage the full force of their technological superiority against us. In that time, they worked in secret, with agents who walked among us. We didn\u2019t know it yet, but they were hard at work convincing the powerful people of the world that the best way, the safest way, the *only* way humanity could endure this invasion was to capitulate to the aliens\u2019 demands: to lay down their arms, welcome the invaders, and turn over control of our cities and militaries and institutions to them.\r\n\r\nIn return, the aliens offered them a veritable paradise without hunger or disease or war. Humanity could have everything it ever longed for, fought for, *killed* for\u2013except its freedom.\r\n\r\nThe aliens had arrived in March. In July, the ADVENT Coalition was formed from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, newly united under a single government both human and alien. Other nations joined them: Belgium, the Netherlands, Guatemala, Belize, and more. But before October was gone, all pretense was finished: ADVENT announced that any nation that wouldn\u2019t welcome the aliens and join the Coalition willingly would be *forcibly* brought into it.\r\n\r\nOpen war.\r\n\r\nThis time, the aliens didn\u2019t hold back. Their advanced weaponry, their monstrous shock troops, their spectacularly advanced spacecraft, their *mind control*. Humanity fought valiantly, but it was never a question of *if* but *when* humanity would fall.\r\n\r\nBy March, 2016, there was no meaningful organized government left on Earth to fight them. ADVENT declared the world unified, finally at peace, and set to work rebuilding the world as the aliens\u2013the *Elders*--envisioned it.\r\n\r\nBut like everything else about ADVENT, it had always been a lie.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the fraught, early chaos of those days, all the world\u2019s concerns fell away and distilled into just one: survive. Though the details of circumstances differed, humans everywhere *did* manage to persevere despite what ADVENT and the aliens could bring to bear. Not enough for our institutions, perhaps, but enough that individuals everywhere yet lived who could remember where they were, and what they did when that primal necessity was all that remained.\r\n\r\nThey *survived.*"

        "comment": "Last Well was a typical stormlands border town. Most of the buildings were prefabs--used and repurposed, mostly--with only a scattering of genuine construction clustered around the eponymous well that gave the place its only meaningful purpose: water just before the stormlands. It didn\u2019t have much else to recommend it. Every few days an arm of the ever-present storm would reach down a wreak terror on the place, and most other times the Ingersoll Company was hellbent on easing its bulk into more and more parts of the town, buying enough people to run the place as a staging ground for trips into the storm.\n\nUr-stones. Everyone wanted the damn things, and Everlorn was the only planet to get them, these days. But she didn't give them up easily.\n\nMost folk failed, dying or coming home empty-handed from the never-ending storm that covered most of Everlorn\u2019s surface. But enough people made it back that adventurers, prospectors, thrill-seekers, and--of course--corporations were willing to try their hand.\n\nBut by and large, if you were on Everlorn huntin\u2019 star seeds, you spent less time out in the storm than you did *gettin\u2019 ready* to enter the storm. Or just waitin\u2019. \n\nOr causin\u2019 trouble.\n\nNobody could remember how the bar brawl started, but that was often the way of full-scale chaos like this. A lot of folk were itchy to vent their frustrations, and the first punch that missed its mark and hit someone else could touch off a veritable fusion core of an explosion. Soon the whole saloon was riled up, and everyone could find at least *someone* they were fixin\u2019 to pound a little. Cheating at cards, stole the girl they were eyein\u2019, spilled a drink, spat on their shoe--real or imagined, any of these were sufficient grounds for a tussle.\n\nAnd one way or another, five *particular* people were all caught up in it. They didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be where the whole mess started.\n\n\u201cGet \u2018em!\u201d someone shouted, and another cheap bottle crashed against the wall.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n*Howdy, and welcome, and thanks for your patience getting started. I'll be putting non-narrative instructions into the story like this going forward.*\n\n*I\u2019m going to be a bit prescriptive for the first couple of scenes until I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re all set on how things work, so you\u2019ll be directed to play specific cards. After that, the story will open up a bit and you all can go, as they say on Everlorn (and other places), \u2018hog wild.\u2019*\n\n*For this first challenge, we\u2019ll be exploring Strength cards. These cards represent your character\u2019s positive aptitudes, skills, talents, abilities, traits, attitudes; anything that causes them to act well in overcoming a challenge. You play them to push a challenge closer to being resolved per the \u2018strong result\u2019 text provided on the Outcomes.*  ***Please only play a non-wild Strength card on this challenge.*** *You\u2019ll also notice that there\u2019s space enough for one card from the each of you. Please do exactly that.*\n\n*The action your character takes should reflect the Strong card provided. It\u2019s expected to be a demonstration of how your character behaved \u2018strongly\u2019 (that is, in a beneficial or advantageous way to achieving the Outcome, per the card you are playing). I\u2019m going to be a bit flexible here since I\u2019ve told you *not* to use wild cards (which can be written in the moment--more on that later), so, for instance, \u2018Good with tools\u2019 could be interpreted to be a familiarity with them for the purposes of clocking some poor sap over the noggin\u2019. Or perhaps locking up a nice place to hide tight and secure. Get imaginative, but if you\u2019re struggling, feel free to ask for assistance.*\n\n*For most challenges, the last person to play on the challenge, or \u2018complete\u2019 it, also has the narrative control to describe how the resolution of that challenge takes place, within the parameters of the text (the Outcome). This is a bit of a departure from, say, an RPG. You as a player have some direct measure of control in determining how the story goes once you\u2019ve completed the challenge. Have fun with it!*\n\n*As always, please ask any comments in the handily provided comments field provided. Again, a reminder:* ***It is public.*** *No personal details, please, and if you\u2019re uncomfortable with asking a question where all can see, PMs to me or posting in the Green Room are perfectly fine, too.*\n\n*Now.

        "comment": "Kumiko watched on her monitors as everything went straight to hell.\n\nThere were multiple breaches in her systems. It seemed someone had infiltrated through every known form of physical security and gotten direct access to her network. Her *real* network, not one of the dupes or paltry business nets, and was causing merry chaos with the electronics all over her state-of-the-art citadel.\n\nNo, not state-of-the-art. *Beyond* state-of-the-art. There were marvels of innovation and technological mastery that hadn\u2019t even been dreamed of in most quarters, her own proprietary designs known to a scant few, but here some mystery hacker had invaded them without physical access, without a signal, without even a *program* to interface with.\n\n*A ghost in the machine.*\n\nBut her physical security was suffering, too. With cameras fritzing and automated turrets stuttering, targeting each other, and doors randomly opening and closing, the most formidable of her defenses were lasciviously spreading their legs to the two men casually wrecking their way through basement, and subbasement, and sub-subbasement\u2026 Heading directly for her vault. \n\nShe had security personnel, of course. Robots, chiefly, but a few biological personnel that she\u2019d considered a necessary precaution in an age of super hackers, electrically charged do-gooders, and technologically potent aliens. Unfortunately, the ex-hero whipping fire like it was going out of style was handling them quite well, even if he hadn\u2019t the support of the other man behind him. That other man looked suspiciously like one of her rivals\u2019 chief operatives, though of course it was difficult to say for certain, what with the all-black, face-obscuring outfit. Still, well-known operatives had a certain style about them, a \u2018costume\u2019 if you will, and this fit the bill.\n\nYes, it was definitely a very well-coordinated strike deep into the heart of her power, and there was very little Kumiko could do about it, even with all her resources and wild intelligence.\n\nExactly as she\u2019d planned.\n\n---\n\nThe thing about being, in essence, a poltergeist was that it afforded a whole new playing field to operate on. Lea had been given very specific instructions about where and how to strike Kumiko\u2019s defenses and what electronics to wreak havoc with, a thing Lea had a remarkable amount of experience in disrupting--mostly whenever it seemed most likely to ruin her haunted murderer\u2019s day. But though Regis had an impressive setup of his own, it really didn\u2019t compare to a top-of-the-line, professional operation like this. There were fascinating intricacies to the Kurosawa systems, layers of redundancies and firewalls (almost literal in her plane of battle), and aggressive countermeasures.\n\nRight. Countermeasures. It struck Lea, immersed in playing poltergeist with a truly enormous haunted house, that Kumiko hadn\u2019t really gone into a great degree of detail about *those.*\n\nLea had learned the hard way that so-called \u2018black\u2019 intrusion countermeasures (or \u2018ICE\u2019) could apparently be blended with mystical elements to create what amounted to spiritual defenders of a completely electronic creation. At least, that\u2019s what she\u2019d managed to deduce from what little she\u2019d overheard during the briefing, and the fact that she was being actively hunted by very angry, very tangible programs. With teeth.\n\nHow did they even *get* teeth?\n\nStill, there was a job to do, and a pressing need to not find out what those teeth could actually do to her. It shouldn\u2019t be much longer before the others could break through\u2026\n\n---\n\nAnother door flew from its frame, crashing into the room beyond. Kieran and the operative behind him stepped over the wreckage of robots and guards knocked cold to survey the next hallway impeding their route to the vault.\n\nThe automated defenses seemed non-functional here, which meant their sort-of-hacker was doing her job, but there was likely to be another wave of physical defenses at any moment. The very best of Kurosawa Robotics would be headed their way--black ops cybernetic soldiers, killbots, and who knows what else? \n\nWell, *they* knew. Kumiko herself had prepped them with full schematics of her most prized creations, recently \u2018stolen\u2019 from one of her datacenters, apparently by a rival. And to some extent that was true\u2026 but the secrets had found their way to them, as well. All the weaknesses, weaponry, tricks and exploits. \n\nOf course, it was still no picnic. Kumiko knew her trade, and she needed this to look good. There was a reason nobody had ever tried this before and succeeded.\n\nBut there was a first time for everything.\n\nOf course, there was a last time for everything, too. The sound of machinery thundered from around a bend in the corridor..."

It cleared away the complexities of politics, proprietary knowledge, and patents to allow the free research of cutting edge science and technology, and undertook to train an elite fighting force for global response to alien threats that might arise. \n\nBut the aliens never came, and the research bore only limited fruit, much of which couldn\u2019t even be used in the world outside XCOM. The Council of Nations funding the project shrank, budget and resources dwindled, and the project soon became a convenient place to offload troublemakers, weirdos, and other inconvenient problems. Its staff became a skeleton crew, its core mission a joke, and its command assignment a career dead end. Only a handful of diehard advocates on the Council kept the project from being entirely scrapped and its assets sold off to the highest bidder.\n\nNow, of course, the aliens *are* here, and this idealistic, atrophied dream is the only force capable of immediate global response.\n\n---\n\n[Link to personnel roster(s)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFuNIjTyxkDYLqs_Vk6u-kGjZ0RXSjYFHybcWH8hERY/edit?usp=sharing).",

        "comment": "##March 1st, 2015\n\n\nThey called it *Operation: Secret Fist,* which was strangely appropriate, because the result of it felt a bit like a punch to the gut.\n\n\nAliens were real. They were *hostile.* They were right in XCOM\u2019s backyard.\n\n\nIt seemed like dumb luck that the first alert of extraterrestrial activity was so close, but that proved to be wishful thinking. S\u00e3o Paulo was one of *three* sites across the globe that had a sudden alien incursion--or so the later report from the Council of Funding Nations said--but it was this closest one that XCOM scrambled the Skyranger and four operatives to respond to. It had happened only a minute *before* the decision to officially activate the XCOM Project came down from an emergency call by the Council.\n\n\nSoon, the base was alive with more activity than the secluded complex had ever experienced in the entirety of its existence. Only the incredible calm in the Commander\u2019s base-wide announcement held the place shy of complete chaos--that, and a deeply ingrained military discipline among so many of the personnel, and a wide understanding that Chief Ndaba (who still preferred \u2018Lieutenant Colonel Ndaba\u2019 or simply \u2018Sir\u2019) would not tolerate *anyone* shirking duty. Even if alien metal were falling from the sky.\n\n\nWhich, reportedly, it was.\n\n\nBy the time the team returned from the op--alive, but with one significant casualty sustained--orders had already been issued to most of the base personnel and the experimental Skyranger found itself competing for space with a flurry of black helicopters hurrying in and out of the base, transporting people, supplies, and equipment. \n\n\nThe good news was that XCOM had funding now. The base, long in a state of ambivalent idleness, with hollowed out underground chambers simply waiting to be turned into usable facilities, was now at the tender mercies of a mobilized construction crew. Word was Felipe had been the first person the Commander spoke with after the emergency call from the Council. Staff had been roused in the middle of the night, long-dormant machinery started up, and the first of the helicopters sent out for additional manpower.\n\n\nMany more followed. XCOM suddenly had much greater needs: More people meant more space, meant more food, meant more *everything.* Manny Lee found himself in the kitchen far earlier than usual, brusquely informed he was now a supervisor, and set loose on whatever culinary conscripts they could muster. \n\n\nA little after dawn, the Council Liaison herself arrived.\n\n\nThere\u2019d never been a Liaison on site before. There\u2019d never been a *need* for one. But the Council was throwing real resources at XCOM for the first time in years, and they weren\u2019t about to let their eyes on it remain distant and unfocused. Iris Li had one priority on her agenda, of course: the Commander.\n\n\nBut while the pair talked, work continued: Research & Development had a sudden need to clear all personal projects and experiments to make way for mission critical work, for not longer after the Operatives returned came the first batch of alien salvage from the field: fragments of technology, alien cadavers, materials samples, and a very curious canister of orange fluid.\n\n\nIt was this last that caught the Chief Scientist\u2019s eye. Dr. Indira Sahni, for her relatively benign appearance and friendly demeanor, had a reputation to match Ndaba\u2019s: she\u2019d been with the Project since its creation, and many believed it was international interest in her experimental weapons research that largely drove it over the years.\n\n\nRight now, though, it was the orange fluid that interested her. \u201cI want everything catalogued and stored securely before we begin. *Be careful.* Reports from the field are that the alien weapons exploded on their deaths. *Don\u2019t* cause any unplanned detonations in my lab.\u201d And that was that. \n\n\nThen she fired of a priority dispatch for the Commander and the Operations Chief:\n\n\n>I need Dr. Darya Ansari acquired for the Project. Address attached.\n\n\nAnd another of Ndaba\u2019s choppers was away.\n\n\nDown in Engineering, the team faced an urgent request to produce two field-ready versions of cutting edge technology they\u2019d only ever built one rudimentary prototype for. It was a \u2018Medkit,\u2019 but not in any conventional fashion--and it was needed. One grievously injured operative had been pulled out of the Skyranger. It was their job to prevent another.\n\n\n*At least it\u2019s not a weapon,* Declan thought. But it was still going to be a pain in the ass to work out the kinks and make adjustments with the new intel from the field.\n\n\nOn and on the list of jobs went. From cutting edge research to simple logistics, there was no end to the support needed to suddenly activate the XCOM Project. In fact, the only people who *didn\u2019t* have a seemingly endless list of things to do were the Field Operatives themselves.\n\n\nFour of them sat ready to respond to the next call for action; the others were told to \u2018relax\u2019 or \u2018pitch in where you can.\u2019 Nobody had any idea when the aliens would strike next, but after their initial strikes, they\u2019d gone completely silent. The hours passed, and the skies remains quiet, but it couldn\u2019t last. The aliens would be back.\n\n\nAnd when they were, it would be four of the field operatives who would face them."

Though largely ignored for decades, the XCOM Project suddenly found itself on the forefront of an alien invasion, responding to incidents across the globe and developing cutting edge weapons and armor based on the aliens\u2019 own technology.\n\nDespite its efforts, though, some nations lost trust in the Project, and chose instead to surrender to and collaborate with the aliens. Seven months after the initial assault, the situation had deteriorated even further, with the promise of open war between the remaining UN nations and this \u2018ADVENT Coalition\u2019 on the horizon. After being subjected to a direct assault from the aliens, proving its secrecy had been compromised, XCOM was shuttered, and its resources divided up among the extant nations fighting ADVENT.\n\n*Most* of its resources.\n\nSome members of XCOM, including its commander and several veteran operatives, chose instead to go AWOL, seizing a specialized aircraft and considerable prototype weapons and armor to continue fighting the aliens with hit-and-run tactics and focused strikes. \n\nThough constantly struggling to maintain resources and combat readiness, this renegade force ultimately outlasted the remaining nations of the Earth. Soon, the entire world had fallen to the ADVENT Coalition, which promptly began to erect pristine, tightly controlled cities and exert control on humanity\u2013except for those who fled their control and attempted to exist in the wilderness and ruined landscape beyond the cities. XCOM continued its fight, shifting from defenders to resistance fighters, trying to slow ADVENT\u2019s oppressive control at every turn and protect those who would strive to live outside the aliens\u2019 influence.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy fight, and every day brings the threat of final defeat, when XCOM will no longer be able to continue, but for almost twenty long years they have persisted. Now, a new opportunity is about to land in XCOM\u2019s lap which might finally give them the tools necessary to fight the aliens on more equal footing. To seize this chance, XCOM will have to go all in, risking everything to unite the fractured Resistance and finally bring the fight to ADVENT.\n\n---\n\nThis is one of three [parallel](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-twilight-kingdom/) [stories](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-this-hollow-valley/) that act as a sequel to [XCOM: Falls the Shadow](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/).

Again.\n\nEveryone felt it as the old, heavily patched and modified plane had touched down on Prince Edward Island. There was a metallic squeal and a rough, tearing sensation as the whole craft\u2019s weight abruptly shifted in the middle of descending.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d Lewis had said cheerily. \u201cShe\u2019s finally done for.\u201d\n\nBut the old bird wobbled valiantly and adjusted, leveling out, and resumed the mostly-vertical descent. She landed rough, with another screech as her weight settled uncomfortably on the makeshift landing pad they\u2019d left many months ago\u2013and then a *bang* as something *else* gave out\u2013probably landing gear\u2013and she lurched unevenly to starboard.\n\n\u201cAny landing you can walk away from,\u201d Sara said, though her fingers trembled a little as she unbuckled from her seat. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be angry,\u201d Bettini muttered, and nobody had to ask who she meant. \n\nNdaba only frowned and climbed out of the bay\u2013and was immediately face-to-face with the livid pilot.\n\n\u201cI *told* you,\u201d Lennie said, her tone a strange mix of manic and furious. \u201cI *told* you she needed more time and repairs, that she wasn\u2019t ready to fly, and *look* what you get. You\u2019re lucky she landed at all, you know that? By all rights she should\u2019ve broken up at a thousand and sent us all down in a rain of shrapnel. And all because *you* wouldn\u2019t wait *three days.*\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ndaba said, and then, in very practiced fashion: \u201cThank you, Lennie, for saving us all from a fiery doom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Lennie prompted.\n\n\u201cAgain.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, only barely appeased, and the pair looked at Condor as the others piled out. Managing cargo was proving a struggle with all the abrupt shifts, but fortunately everything had been tied down *very* securely.\n\n\u201cWill she fly again?\u201d Ndaba asked.\n\nLennie gave a heavy, exasperated sigh. \u201cHonestly? I think that might be it for her this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really mean it this time. Miguel and I have gotten *way* more out of her than XCOM ever envisioned, but we\u2019re not wizards.\u201d She glared at Ndaba again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have rushed us. What the *hell* was so important that we had to be across North America *right now*? I thought we were going to be operating in the west for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI received some intelligence we cannot afford to ignore.\u201d\n\nIt took Lennie just a moment to work that out. \u201cWait. You mean\u2026?\u201d\n\nNdaba nodded. \n\n\u201cBut\u2026 But *how?* When? We\u2019d have damn sure heard about one of their ships getting shot out of the sky.\u201d\n\nNdaba shook her head. \u201cNot recent. We found an old one. *The* old one.\u201d She nodded in Corwin\u2019s direction as the ex-pilot wandered down Condor\u2019s ramp, arms heavy with more of their cargo. \u201cThe one flyboy shot down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one he shot down\u2026 *thirteen years ago?* In *our* Firestorm? I thought you said this was a rush!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is\u2013for other reasons.\u201d Ndaba started walking. \u201cCome on, Kestrel should already be here. Kethry! With us!\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m not happy to see you,\u201d Sloane said. \u201cJust didn\u2019t expect you back this way so soon. Thought it was \u2018too hot\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey met on the Snowblind\u2019s bridge. What remained of the old, temporary base of operations on the island had been shuttered so thoroughly as to be useless without significant work\u2013and Ndaba didn\u2019t actually intend to hang around long enough to use it. \u201cExtenuating circumstances,\u201d she explained. \u201cThank you for making the time. We\u2019ll need your help.\u201d\n\nSloane spread her arms. \u201cIf it\u2019s in my power. What\u2019s the op?\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cEquipment or personnel?\u201d\n\nNdaba smiled. \u201cBoth.\u201d At her urging, they unrolled a regional map for reference. \u201cEver since Corwin here joined us, we\u2019ve been on the lookout for that harvester-class alien ship he shot down\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cHe *claims* he shot down,\u201d Lennie added.\n\n\u201cI think we can dispense with the \u2018alleged\u2019, as his information helped our contacts track it down.\u201d Ndaba pointed. \u201cIt is here.\u201d\n\nLennie\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s Lake Ontario.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re standing on a boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you were so insistent on diving equipment,\u201d Sloane added. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting the picture. But you said personnel, too.\u201d\n\nNdaba nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the urgent part.\u201d She pointed to another part of the map, somewhere in former New York state. \u201cThere is a survivor community approximately *here* that has been attracting a lot of attention lately. It seems they have proven surprisingly *resistant* to ADVENT patrols, with unusually advanced defenses and other resources at their disposal. They suspect something is up and have been collecting data on the inhabitants as best they can. Our contact in City 31 sent me this.\u201d She dropped a photograph on the table.\n\n\u201cTheir resolution is *surprisingly* good,\u201d Corwin muttered. \"Should we know her?\"\n\n\u201cOh hell no,\u201d Lennie said. \u201cIs that who I think it is? *Hell* no.\u201d\n\nNdaba pressed her lips together. \u201cAs you observed, our salvage target is in a lake; it is the only reason the aliens have left it there for so long. If we are to get it running again, we need a technological specialist who has a proven record of reverse engineering their devices and innovating on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Swamp\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cSwapnali is exceptionally skilled, but her expertise is not physics and electromechanical engineering. She is the missing piece we\u2019ve needed to make this work\u2013and ADVENT is coming for her.\u201d\n\nLennie groaned, pinched the bridge of her nose, and turned to pace the small bridge. \u201c...can\u2019t believe this\u2026\u201d\n\nSloane raised a hand. \u201cFor those of us who *weren\u2019t* back there in your glory days\u2026?\u201d\n\nNdaba smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve found an old colleague. She is as difficult to work with as she is brilliant--and she is *very* brilliant. Peralta, is your new project ready?\u201d\n\nShe turned. \u201cSkyranger 2.0? Well we need to *assemble* her after bundling her up for transport, but she\u2019ll fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the new software?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean \u2018can we spoof an ADVENT signal and fly totally under their radar?\u2019 *In theory,* but we\u2019ve never tested Carlos\u2019s new toy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to hope he's made no mistakes. Here is the plan\u2026\u201d\n\n---\n\nIn the end, they were divided into three teams:\n\nNdaba would be dropped off in reasonable hiking distance to City 31, to infiltrate through the tunnels with a small team. While they could *find* the downed alien ship, they still needed the ability to crack its security, and a face-to-face with their contact was the only way to manage that. \n\nAfter dropping them off, Lennie would take a strike team led my Lewis directly to their \u2018old colleague's\u2019 doorstep\u2013hopefully beating ADVENT\u2013and convince her to join their noble mission.\n\nFinally, Sloane would take the Snowblind upriver and onto Lake Ontario to the site of the crashed ship\u2013a mission that required navigating the old locks and canals on the way (functional, but poorly maintained, and occasionally the subject of ADVENT patrols). Several operatives would join for the trip, just to ensure any trouble encountered was dealt with.\n\nOf course, unbeknownst to all of them, events were unfolding within City 31 that would threaten their whole, desperate undertaking."

It was the *sound*--or rather, the total lack of white ship noise that accompanied any warship like this one. If it wasn\u2019t something mechanical on the fritz, it\u2019d be the hum of air scrubbers, or the subtle vibrations from other crew wandering around nearby, or just the thrum of voices.\n\nBut there was nothing. It was all silent.\n\nThe other bunks were empty, and undisturbed. The viewport still showed space, but there was something off about the stars. It was like she\u2019d awoken in a simulation of her quarters, all uncanny valley, but someone had forgotten to get the small details right.\n\nSo if she wasn\u2019t on the ship\u2026 where the hell *was* she?\n\n---\n\n***Hallam-***\n\nHe left Faerie, driven only by the desire to find some place as broken as he felt, passing through the tree and emerging into an aspen grove, already aflame.\n\nThe smoke stung and clawed at his lungs, but there was more of it than there was fire, when he could gather his senses. There *was* fire, though, a young blaze just beginning to find its feet. He knew that with a little time, it\u2019d have the kind of momentum that would be hard to stop. \n\nThe air was too dry, but there wasn\u2019t much wind\u2013yet. There was a chance to stop this early.\n\nThe strangest part, though, was that as Hallam peered around the grove to get a sense of its scope and his surroundings, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was really outdoors, or indoors; there were *shelves* somewhere behind the smoke, nestled amid the foliage. And *books.* At least, for a moment, it seemed like they were books\u2026\n\nBooks burned pretty well, too, though.\n\n---\n\n***Kyllian-***\n\nHe swore his allegiance to darkness, destruction, and chaos. He banished the tyranny of light, heard the goddess scream into the aether, and found himself immersed in darkness.\n\nAlone.\n\nPlucked out by Maelevon to another plane? Was that part of the deal? Or was this something in retaliation, some cost for what he\u2019d done? Was this punishment? Sacrifice?\n\nHe\u2019d never killed a goddess before\u2026\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d he called again, and the word echoed back at him.\n\nSlowly, though, the darkened halls resolved into something more. Maybe it was a gift of darkness, or maybe his eyes were just adjusting. In the dimness, he could make out walls\u2013no, *shelves.* Vellum scrolls and old leatherbound tomes adorning them, not unlike an ancient, sacred temple archive of some kind. Though never had he heard of one so *vast\u2026*\n\nHis vision continued to clear; the lamps lit around him, dimmed behind him, but they were getting brighter. All they revealed, though, was more of the same.\n\nA seemingly infinite library stretched onward. But at least it had branching paths.\n\n---\n\n***Rosalita-***\n\nShe rode as if her life depended on it\u2013it did, incidentally\u2013trying to remember her geography, to know where to meet back up with her boys; with Tommy. But she hadn\u2019t counted on the storm.\n\nThere shouldn\u2019t have been such a storm, but it came upon her with sudden and terrible speed, and soon she was immersed in it. Thunder sounded in a cacophony around her, lightning flashed and disoriented her, *Satanas* vocally expressed his dismay. \n\nSoon, she was well and truly lost.\n\nIt might\u2019ve been five minutes, or it might\u2019ve been hours, but eventually a shape loomed ahead out of the haze of rain and lashing winds: a building. It was better than nothing.\n\n---\n\n***Monika-***\n\n\u201cNot in a million years\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c...a million years\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c...million years\u2026\u201d\n\nThe sound of her own voice spiraled around and around, growing faster, like an audio recording getting warped by some mechanical aberration.

And empty, except for her, and all the paintings.\n\nWas this\u2026part of the whole thing? Somehow?\n\n---\n\n***McCoy-***\n\nHe was in a cemetery. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *normal* cemetery, either; it was about as stereotypically dark and ominous as one could be, which strongly suggested a dream or something more chemically-enhanced. If it were a movie, it\u2019d have been criticized for being too over-the-top: the thick fog, the greenish luminescence, the leaning tombstones and looming mausoleums\u2026all the goddamn *ghosts*.\n\nMost of them weren\u2019t clear enough to make out, but they sure as hell were there: their voices a muted murmur across the wind, distinguishable only as heavy with regret and sorrow; their shapes more movement than image\u2013a hint of something at one periphery, a rush of wind past his shoulder, that kind of thing. He could *almost* make them out.\n\nThey seemed to be getting clearer, after all.\n\n---\n\n***Romy-***\n\nShe was alone in what should have been the bookstore: no Barty, no Wainwright. Another look around assured her that it was *definitely* too long an aisle, far too large for the space, and with more branching aisles than she remembered. And the air! It was as if a vast space had opened up around her, and the stuffy bookstore air was rushing out, replaced by the coolness of the outdoors. Only *that* wasn\u2019t true, either. As far as she could tell, she was still indoors.\n\nThe bookstore was getting very large, now. It was getting difficult to tell which direction was which, too; despite the seemingly unending secondhand books and diverse array of volumes, there was a sameness to one row after the next that made orienting oneself challenging. \n\nIt would be easy to get lost in a place like this.\n\n---\n\n***Verne-***\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure exactly what went down with the people he was with, the folks what had a gun on them, and the feller stealing supplies. Had there been a scuffle? Had they run? He had a vague recollection of running down a slender side passage in that cavern, trying to get well and clear of any firefight. But it had just gone on, and on, and now it seemed like he\u2019d been plunging through this tunnel for ages.\n\nIt was looking less and less like a cavern, too. The walls were turning from rough rock into smooth stone, and then into brick; the floor from an irregular incline to a ramp to stairs; overhead, at some point, a naked bulb suspended, offering a struggling light.\n\nPlace looked more like a cellar or basement than it did a cave, all of a sudden.\n\n\u201cHello\u2026?\u201d\n\nHis voice didn\u2019t echo, which was the first surprising thing; the second was that he started hearing *other* voices up ahead.\n\n\u2018Course\u2026voices could also be trouble. Some of \u2018em just were.\n\nNo sooner did Verne reckon he didn\u2019t have much choice but to head forward anyway, when lo and behold, a branch in the tunnel\u2013or rather, another corridor\u2013opened up to one side. Another way.\n\nBut should he take it, or head to the voices? Could be the folk he was traveling with; could be the devil, too, come to collect. It sure was getting weird enough for it\u2026"

The weather was temperate, the streets clean, and everything seemed to be running like clockwork. Viewing things only superficially, one could be mistaken for assuming the whole city ran with idyllic precision and ease.\n\nBut the devil, as always, was in the details.\n\nNot that many people talked about \u2018devils\u2019 anymore. Once upon a time, many had insisted that the Elders and the other species they guided were \u2018devils\u2019, and that had since been proven wildly false. Now, people talked less and less of superstition and supernatural belief. After all, with the miracles occurring every day, with the floating images of near-angels in their own midst, it wasn\u2019t really a matter of *belief* at all.\n\nStill, despite the decline of religion, St. Anthony\u2019s Chapel still stood. There\u2019d been a lot of talk about decommissioning it, using its valuable place for something of more tangible use to the common good\u2013but there were also a lot of people who seemed to *like* the old chapel. It had history; symbolism; meaning.\n\nAnd lots of old relics, apparently.\n\n\u201cWord\u2019s come from above,\u201d City 31\u2019s Content Director explained to the other media content planners\u2013**Vesta** included\u2013at the daily meeting. \u201cThey\u2019re going to repurpose the site of the chapel, and we\u2019ve been asked to help the populace understand this decision.\u201d\n\nIn other words, they had to put a positive spin on what was surely going to piss off a segment of the populace. Nobody wanted Lancers getting called in to suppress a wave of unrest.\n\n**Libby** was present as well, as one of the more important go-fers not otherwise preoccupied with other matters. Her biggest project remained the youth group, and that didn\u2019t consume her time until much later in the day. But even if she wasn\u2019t making decisions, she could still offer input\u2013or at least get people to say things that might have some utility later on.\n\n---\n\nElsewhere in the city, **Jon** was also struggling with the fallout of this impending decision, albeit unexpectedly. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not what we do,\u201d he explained to the woman in front of him, pleading with him to take the box she held out. You\u2019re looking for the museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t take it,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cThey say it\u2019s not part of their\u2013uh, how did he put it?--Not part of the legacy they\u2019re conserving. Please, I just don\u2019t want these to be *destroyed*, they have spiritual value. They are *actual fragments of saints*. Even if you don\u2019t believe, surely you can see the historical and cultural value.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is a library\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just\u2026store them somewhere? Keep them safe? And when we\u2019ve found somewhere to keep our faith going, we\u2019ll come get them. Please?\u201d\n\nIt was *probably* doable, but it was certainly not one of his official duties and would be deeply frowned upon if an ADVENT administrator ever found out. That could have serious repercussions. Not that they usually paid much attention to things out of public sight\u2026\n\n---\n\nShiblon had never seemed very keen on the Chapel repurposing project, but now that it seemed all but certain, he seemed *very* busy. **Layla** hadn\u2019t seen him at work quite this early before. Not that he wasn\u2019t diligent, but this did seem unusual. Maybe he\u2019d thought his counter proposal would go through, and now that it wasn\u2019t, he had work to catch up on.\n\nThat was probably it.\n\nThe extra quiet in the morning meant she had time to reflect on how they\u2019d come to where they are, though, and that wasn\u2019t necessarily bad. Sometimes it did seem to be too good to be true\u2026\n\n---\n\nOne idea getting tossed around in the media meeting included another initiative underway in the city: a special opportunity for workers at the newly refurbished gene therapy clinic to collaborate with some of the manufacturing district\u2019s best and brightest on a new prototype implant.\n\nThere was admittedly some question surrounding how seriously to take this initiative: how much of it was an educational opportunity, and how much of it was a serious undertaking. After all, the project\u2019s directors had specifically assigned very young (though up-and-coming) specialists to the initiative. Included among them were **Chloe** Kethry, **Lucas** Almeida, and Alec Fischer. They were all near enough in age to already know one another from school and aptitude evals, all respectably skilled (even very impressive, by some marks), but why not more senior personnel?\n\nWhatever the reason, these youths and others had been given the project. The goal: review a proposed prototype implant for efficacy and see if they could improve on the design.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t expected to be easy, and no small part of that was because they hadn\u2019t actually been *told* much about the implant, or its purpose. They knew it was intended for the Peacekeeping division, but not precisely *how*. They\u2019d been given schematics, one copy of the device itself, and several benchmark test results. It seemed they were expected to strictly focus on the mechanics of the implant.\n\nThough that didn\u2019t mean that they couldn\u2019t speculate\u2026\n\n---\n\n**Cole** was expected to be in class\u2013such as it was for the citizens on sub-basic income, living out in \u2018Shankville\u2019 outside the walls. He had half a mind to skip it; he was already eyeing an early jump into the workforce, hoping to make some extra credits out in the meat vats, like some of his peers already were. The only thing that kept him from jumping in full force was that he was also distracted training for his debut fight.\n\nIt was *tonight.* How could he focus on book learning when he had to get ready for his trial bout tonight? It was set to be in Old Town, of course, deep in the tunnels where such unauthorized fights could go unnoticed. But *everyone* was going to be there. Anyone worth a damn, anyway. Maybe even\u2013\n\nDid his eyes deceive him? There, standing at the Switchyard station, waiting for her own train (probably to somewhere much better) was none other than semi-famous street racer **Starlyn** Roth (though she did above board racing as well, Cole was of course most interested in the tunnel races she sometimes engaged in). Outside the fighting world, racers were the next greatest thing.\n\nAnd right now, it seemed Starlyn was being stalked and followed by two grim, stony-faced individuals in bland, dark clothes. A more astute observer might\u2019ve realized these were ADVENT administrators intent on having a \u2018chat\u2019 with Star\u2013one could only guess why\u2013but Cole didn\u2019t have all that much experience with city administrators. Whether he understood who they were\u2013or even cared\u2013remained to be seen. If Star was in trouble, maybe it didn\u2019t matter from who.\n\n---\n\n**Maya** was preparing for school, too and deeply considering something so terrible that she\u2019d never before dared to contemplate it: skipping class.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that ADVENT was particularly punishing about missing school\u2013at least in small increments\u2013but it was her obligation to be there! And Maya hated shirking her responsibilities. And what if lack of perfect attendance somehow disqualified her from the Peacekeeper program?\n\nBut there were extenuating circumstances. Her parents and Uncle Barrett were up to something\u2013she\u2019d heard them whispering again\u2013and she *really* wanted to know what it was. She suspected it had something to do with this weird, special new project Alec was getting because of how perfectly smart he was; Maria said Lucas was on it, too, and that just made her *more* curious.\n\nNow, it *was* Maria\u2019s idea to go snoop and figure out what their older brothers were up to, so maybe it wouldn\u2019t go too badly for her if they were caught. As long as they were finished before youth group meeting in the afternoon, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026\n\n---\n\nSpeaking of \u2018Uncle Barrett\u2019, he was already hard at work. He and **Ren** worked the same beat for manufacturing: the resource retrieval, repair, supply, resupply, and other logistics stuff that, for the most part, nobody else wanted to do. It generally involved a lot of running around, a lot of sifting through databases, squinting at serial numbers, conversations with other employees who\u2019d \u2018forgotten\u2019 to check equipment out, and so on.\n\nIn Ren\u2019s case, she was perpetually stuck with the job because of her many, many\u2026.*many* infractions. A \u2018problem worker\u2019, it was something of a miracle that they kept her on at all, except that she did wind up with a very impressive recovery rate\u2026despite seeming to constantly lose datapads. \n\nBarrett, on the other hand\u2026 Ren was never really sure how Barrett got stuck with the job, but he actually seemed content with it. \u201cBetter than sticking my hand under a giant laser,\u201d he\u2019d chortle.\n\nSecretly, Ren wondered if it wasn\u2019t that both of them shared the same sort of miserable past: they were both survivors from across the ocean, from nations that had surrendered to ADVENT rapidly and wasted no time in breaking up their families. Barrett had recovered most of his, but Ren had always suspected that, like her, he was still looking for others.\n\nAnd logistics was a decent place to color outside the lines a little, as it were.\n\nOn this particular morning, Barrett seemed especially involved in\u2026something. He was being cagey about it, which meant it probably wasn\u2019t strictly within their assigned duties. But maybe Ren could tease the information out of him."

        "post_title": "In April of 1919, an expedition led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle set out from New York with ambitions to explore tombs in Egypt. By October of that same year, the expedition was feared missing; in the following year, the site of their massacre was uncovered, albeit with many lingering questions--and bodies unaccounted for.\n\nNow it is January of 1925. Your good friend Jackson Elias, a noted investigative writer on the occult--particularly obscure death cults--has called on you and others to meet with him in New York.  \n\nHe tells you it's about the Carlyle Expedition.\n\nHe tells you he needs reliable help--your help--to aid his investigation.\n\n---\n\nThis story is a long adventure that will focus on investigating a mystery, foiling a world-spanning, malevolent plan, and confronting cosmic and existential horror. It is long, it is involved, and it is likely to get hopelessly dark at times.\n\nThis story is also an experiment in translating a well-known Call of Cthulhu roleplaying campaign into the Storium model. You don't require any familiarity with the RPG itself to participate. There will be no dice rolls, no character sheets; the objective is to use Storium to provide a more narrative experience for this well-loved adventure. In fact, I would like to avoid players who are already familiar with the campaign if at all possible. \n\nWhat *will* help is familiarity with H.P. Lovecraft or the Cthulhu Mythos generally. Lovecraftian Horror, while it often contains elements of traditional horror and psychological horror, also delves into cosmic horror--the terror of coping with mankind's insignificance in a vast, incomprehensible universe in which humans are a tiny, negligible part.\n\nBut there is hope there. This is not intended to be a story of never-ending darkness and failure. It is a struggle in the face of overwhelming odds in a desperate bid to stem the tide of vile, corrupt powers.\n\nThough failure, too, is a possible result.\n\n---\n\n##The Story So Far\n\n**Chapter 1** - Eight individuals find themselves called or drawn to the hotel room of Jackson Elias, world-traveling author of occult volumes detailing the horrific exploits of death cults. Known for skepticism and in depth research, the man now sounds desperate and fearful and in need of their help to research events of the Carlyle Expedition, a doomed journey undertaken by rich playboy Roger Carlyle, with several others, which led to a massacre of all members in the Kenyan uplands. \n\nBut at the prescribed meeting, the investigators instead discover the author, for many their *friend,* killed in ritualistic fashion. They kill or drive off the murderers, and find scattered around the room numerous clues as to what Elias was involved in. It is agreed by all that they must take up the investigation he meant for them and, if possible, avenge his death. Armed with little more than fragmentary references to New York, London, Egypt, Kenya, Shanghai, and even Polynesia, the investigation begins.\n\n**Chapter 2** - The investigators begin pursuing leads from Elias's hotel room, first venturing to Harvard and Arkham, but emerging with little to show for it. They then look closer to home at Emerson Imports and the files of Dr. Huston, of the Carlyle Expedition. It soon becomes clear that Elias was interested in a place called Ju-Ju House, which Emerson handles imports for.\n\n**Chapter 3** - The investigators narrow their focus to the Ju-Ju House, a store of authentic African tribal items buried in the back alleys of Harlem. After a cursory investigation, they opt to break-in at night in full force, discovering rather more than they bargained for: a death cult, unearthly creatures, unnatural abominations, and prisoners meant for something hideous. It becomes apparent that the mystery Elias was onto involved more than they ever could have guessed, almost beyond belief itself.\n\nAfter their liberation, Dean Chang and Alice Early join the investigators in their search for answers.\n\n**Chapter 4** - The cult broken up, the murders solved--at least on the surface--the investigators have a brief moment of respite. All clues lead outside of the country, now, and so it is agreed that they will start with London--nearest, and Elias's last visit before New York.\n\nLizzie, Andrew, and Ruth leave the group, the toll of the dark mystery proving too much. The others bid a final farewell to Elias at his funeral, where they meet Elias's publisher, who entrusts them with Elias's notes from Kenya. Some also peruse the remains of the Ju-Ju House, but there is little left to discover there except the haunting memory of the thing in the basement.\n\n**Chapter 5** - The investigators arrives in London in order to ascertain the activities of Jackson Elias while there. They interview one of his old friends and Edward Gavigan, director of the Penhew Foundation (whose namesake, Sir Aubrey Penhew, was killed in the Carlyle Expedition massacre). It appears another string of ritualistic murders is underway here--still unsolved--that Jackson had a keen interest in, believing it to be the work of a death cult.",

        "comment": "#Jackson Elias\n\n##January 15th, 1925 - New York City, NY\n\n>*\u201cThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\u201d*\n&nbsp;\n-Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston\n\n---\n\n***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-***\n\nThe telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. He\u2019d certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now?\n\nThe second piece of information was that he\u2019d said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps.\n\nThere was some time between receipt of Jackson\u2019s telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself.\n\nNot a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies.\n\n    BIG APPLE DATELINE\n    April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! You\u2019ve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt he\u2019ll dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands?\n\n---\n\n    CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND\n    April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard.\n\n    Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month.\n\n    Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyle\u2019s trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites.\n\n    Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt.\n\n    OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations.\n\n    Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable \u2018Freudian\u2019 psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs.\n\n    Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist.\n\n    Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum.\n\n    Additional members may be secured while in London.\n\n---\n\n    CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT\n    July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a \u2018well-earned rest.\u2019\n\n    Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari \u201cin respite from our sandy labors.\u201d\n\n    Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke.\n\n    Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel.\n\n---\n\n    IMPORTANT VISITORS\n    July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypt\u2019s Nile Valley.\n\n    Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence.\n\n    Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. \n\n    The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting.\n\n---\n\n    CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST\n    Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months.\n\n    The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom.\n\n    The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures.\n\n    Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi.\n\n---\n\n    ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA\n    March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life.\n\n    Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest.\n\n    Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition.\n\n    Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow.\n\n    Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyle\u2019s purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship.\n\n---\n\n    CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED\n    May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives.\n\n    Roger Carlyle, New York\u2019s rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing.\n\n    Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites.\n\n    Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyle\u2019s sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site.\n\n    Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead.\n\n---\n\n    MURDERERS HANGED\n    June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial.\n\n    To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment.\n\n    Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice.\n\n---\n\nAnd so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. \n\nSure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldn\u2019t say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear.\n\n---\n\n***Shane-***\n\nShane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jackson\u2019s precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his father\u2019s correspondences, perhaps as often as he\u2019d seen the man himself. \n\nMuch like Jackson, Shane\u2019s father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. He\u2019d come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before he\u2019d finished the telling of his latest escapade he\u2019d be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on\u2026\n\nUntil he *didn\u2019t* come back.\n\nIt had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; they\u2019d even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadn\u2019t even appeared for the funeral; he\u2019d been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his father\u2019s boys\u2019 club of ne\u2019er-do-well \u2018adventurers.\u2019\n\nAnd that had been the last they\u2019d heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now.\n\nThe request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his father\u2019s \u2018Australia notes,\u2019 the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father might\u2019ve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something.\n\nBetter still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps he\u2019d learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadn\u2019t expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition.\n\nDead. Surely, dead. He couldn\u2019t be alive after all this time...could he?\n\nDamn it all.\n\nWhen Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly.\n\n---\n\n***Andrew-***\n\nAndrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. They\u2019d told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter\u2026 He\u2019d barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely he\u2019d be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it.\n\nThe voices told him about the man he\u2019d followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.*\n\nCharming titles, really.\n\nWhatever he tried, though, Andrew couldn\u2019t catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. \n\nWhen they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place.\n\n*\u201cEight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,\u201d* the woman\u2019s voice implored.\n\n*\u201cWatch them,\u201d* the man\u2019s voice countered.\n\nThe whispers trailed off.\n\n---\n\n***Elizabeth-***\n\nIt had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. She\u2019d have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didn\u2019t much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there weren\u2019t many other options available.\n\nWell. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.*\n\nHer investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the man\u2019s services to watch for Andrew\u2019s arrival. \n\nUnfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently he\u2019d been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. They\u2019d released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator.\n\nWhich meant it had reached Elizabeth. \n\nHer latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didn\u2019t matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own.\n\n---\n\n***Goldie-***\n\nHarry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldn\u2019t just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. \n\nA couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes.\n\n*Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe\u2026\n\nAll right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harry\u2019s debts with the right\u2026*persuasion.* That\u2019d be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person.\n\nHell, maybe they\u2019d just plug Harry once she was done. Not her business. But one way or another, Goldie was gonna get paid tonight."
