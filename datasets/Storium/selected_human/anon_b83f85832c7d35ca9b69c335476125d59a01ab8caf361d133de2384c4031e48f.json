His shift rotation had him working second shift which was midnight until noon but that didn't seem to matter much either. \n\nIt was a Russian holiday today and he had specifically requested the day off and been granted it. None of that seemed to stop his boss and department chief Gulina Tarasnova from scheduling him for work and not notifying him of the change however. It was true he and Gulina didn't see eye-to-eye. Her height was the first obstacle to that. She was easily six and a half feet tall and built stout; long black hair and blue eyes; pretty once though her face was hard and showed an age that was not yet hers. \n\nShe thought he was too pretty and too soft for the work he did; that he cared too much and involved himself too much beyond just the physical well-being of his patients. She thought he was lazier than the Russian nurses, that he was inferior. \n\n\"He will crumble\" he had overheard her saying to his co-workers once. \"He is not Russian.\"\n\nAs he arrived at the Hospital he noted the emergency entrance on the ground level was open and two paramedics were bringing a gurney through with an adult male patient on it, covered up to his neck in a thin green blanket. There were two other ambulances parked with their back doors wide open. \n\n*Looks like Julia wasn't exaggerating - its going to be busy.*\n\nAs he made his from the staff entrance to the locker room and changing area he was aware of the heightened buzz of activity in the hospital in general. The in-house clinic was packed, with patients lining the halls waiting to get in. There were people sitting on the floor in the hall outside the emergency area as well; the seating areas inside the ward obviously full. \n\nHe had just opened the door to his locker when he heard footsteps behind him.\n\n\"There you are!\" came a familiar voice. It belonged to Julia. He turned and found a more disheveled version than he was used to. Her scrubs had smears of blood and other stains on them, her respirator was hanging down around her neck and she was sweaty; with wisps of her auburn hair having detached from her ponytail and dangling crazily. \n\n\"The fuck dude?\" she asked. \"You're never this late for pre-shift.\" \n\nShe tossed a pair of bright blue nitrile gloves into a garbage can, but one missed and hit the wall before falling to the floor. \n\n\"Gulina's is on the warpath and we've had four cases of Giardia Infection since last night. I don't know were the shit ends and the puke begins,\" she said holding her arms out and looking down at her filthy scrubs."

        "comment": "#DAY 1#\n**Day of Unity - Russian Holiday**\n**Friday, November 4, 2016 7:13AM**\n\nThe black Volga 4-Runner SUV sat idling in the gravel alongside Ulitsa Plotina GES, the narrow two lane street that ran across the top of the Irkustk Hydroelectric Dam. \n\nKonstantine was at the wheel, alternating his attention from his styrofoam cup of black coffee and his phone. He was in a mood, and even before they had pulled off the road and into the gravel clearing on top of the dam he had been growing steadily more frustrated by the text messages he was receiving.\n\nThe smell of stale alcohol and cigarettes hadn't escaped Zoryana when she had gotten into the SUV, nor had the fresh, purple-colored stamp on the back of his left hand just below the cuff of his heavy bomber jacket. These days he only smoked when he drank and only drank when he was out at the nightclubs. He'd been out last night and today he was paying for it. Hell, they were both paying for it. He had probably been with Yelena again and had predictably sought the company of his boorish friend Roman to escape his girlfriends ire. Roman was single and worked with his father fix months out of the year up in the Norilsk sector in Tunguska, about three hours drive north of Irkutsk.  When he wasn't working Roman spent his time doing his best to live like a rock star and doing what he could to see to it Konstantine became and remained single. \n\nThey were longtime friends but even Konstantine had of late complained about the constant drinking and partying. \n\nYelena was loyal, independent and beautiful. She had high expectations for herself and for Konstantine and saw Roman for the degenerate he was. \n\n\"Yebat' menya.\" Konstantine cursed under his breath, shaking his head and tossing his phone into the cup holder beside him. \"Yebat' menya.\" he said again, staring out the window. There was a little less venom in his voice this time and some of the conviction had gone out of his words as well. \n\nOutside the SUV, a red city bus with electric trolley arms sped by going well above the posted 60 kilometer an hour limit. Its passing buffeted their vehicle, throwing up a wake of dirty snow. Beyond the road was a stretch of beach; white not from sand but snow and stretching along the southern side of the dam. Beyond that was the reservoir that was the wide Angara River. Flanked on both sides of the roughly 3 km wide river were low treed hills that stretched on into a widening river basin which some 50 km upstream took its waters from massive Lake Baikal.\n\n\"Zory, here.\" Konstantine said, holding out a set of keys for her. His phone vibrated in the cup-holder and the screen lit up again.\n\n\"I have some things I need to take care of,\" he said, pulling his black trapper hat lower on his forehead and picking up his phone distractedly.\n\nOutside the wind was howling, stirring up particles of ice and snow which assailed the windows, making a crackling sound which warned about the cold that was to come."

The reef \u2019s too taxing on boats here so you\u2019ll have to make your way there. Of course that means finding a boat or swimming a quarter mile of ocean water. Not to mention navigating to the northern tip of the island and hoping the folks holed up there haven\u2019t  already taken the last boat across. The lights are flickering low. \n\nIt\u2019s time to move.\n\n---\n\nThis is an experimental game; a way for myself and a few like-minded players to test out a version of the \"Ten Candles\" RPG system by Cavalry Games adapted for use in Storium. Elements of both will be tweaked and made to suit what we're trying to do. \n\nFirst and foremost you need to understand that Ten Candles is a tragic horror game. Your character is going to die in this one. No ifs ands or buts. \n\nAs designer Stephen Dewey wrote: \n\n_\"The middle of a sunless apocalypse. The sky has darkened  and turned against you. Satellites have gone quiet, leaving  you without solar power, cell phones, internet, GPS, and many other luxuries that the world has grown accustomed to. Power grids have failed on a global scale against the demand and the world has been left in darkness. And now, They have come. It is uncertain what They are, but  They\u2019re out there in the dark, and They\u2019re coming for you.\"_\n\n_Ten Candles is not a game about \"winning\" or beating the monsters. Instead, it is a game about what happens in the dark and about those who try to survive within it. It is a game about being pushed to the brink of madness and despair, searching for hope in a hopeless world and trying to do something meaningful with your final few hours left._\n\nIf you have any inclination that you want to contradict this, or propose a way that your character can survive, don't. That's not the goal here. \n\nIf you are interested in applying I invite you to take part in the planning conversation taking place on slack at the link below:\n\n**Ten Candles-Storium Slack**\nhttps://storium-chat.slack.com/messages/CBHRE7W00\n\n---\n\nOther helpful links\n\n**Ten Candles Website**\nhttp://cavalrygames.com/ten-candles/\n\n**Google Share Files**\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1t_iLk8GUZ-lX3UcxqmccOQbaQ67FPQwp",

Never dawned on me how fast everything could just stop.  \n\nI assumed civilizations from every era of human history wrongly believed some version of the same doomsday nonsense. That things were changing too fast. That morals were slipping. That goodness was fading. That the next generation was lost. That war or disease or some other calamity would bring our end. That there was a growing corruption in the belly of the world; a malignancy that would gnaw its way through and show itself one day and rise like a wave and recede only once it had consumed everything. That the end was coming and coming soon.\n\nHadn\u2019t every generation born since God had these doubts and thought these thoughts in some way? \n\nI really believed that\u2019s how it was. Took comfort in it. That it was all a part of the human condition. That perpetual feeling of dread over the uncertainty of the future was hard-wired into us but that ultimately the world would spin on and humanity would keep on living much as it always had. I took great comfort knowing most people had it wrong. That the world more or less had always been this way and always would be this way. \n\nBut I guess we were the first civilization to have it right. About the end.\n\nTHEY came. Ten days ago. \n\nThey stole the light. The stars, the moon. Extinguished or obscured or destroyed. Things went black. They brought the end. \n\nThere was a swell of horror and chaos. \n\nLike a crashing wave on the surf the water finally ebbed and we unlucky few who were left had to look out from where we hid at the things scattered on the beach. At what remained of the world we had lost. \n\nWe're starving. Surrounded by water but dying of thirst. Afraid to light a fire to attract them. Listening. Watching. Waiting.\n\nIn the darkness I feel the warmth of the world failing. The pulse of her heart slacking. She is dying. We are dying. These last pitiful stragglers, hiding in the wreckage of lives we all thought were owed us. Things taken for granted. That one day we would have a better life and better version of ourselves.  What bullshit that was. The great fucking illusion. That we are owed something better.\n\nWe're living proof that things can always get worse.\n\nWhen my little girl would have nightmares I would go to her and whisper that the sun will always rise in the morning. There is always light after the darkness. \n\nBut the sun hasn\u2019t risen in ten days.\"\n\n---\n\nThe island resort has turned into a nightmare. The beach sand has turned so thick with blood that not even the tide can wash it away. There aren\u2019t many folks left... not since They came. \n\nJust the group of you, and from the crackled interference on the radio, it sounds like one other group holed up on the far end of the island at another resort.

        "post_title": "#FALL#\n\nIt's been nine years. \n\nNine years since the shit hit the fan. \n\nNine years since the comfortable, American way of life most people knew came to an abrupt and terrifying end. \n\nNine years since you, one of the so-called _\"lucky few\"_, entered a remote bunker on the northern edge of the Ute Mountain Tribe Reservation in southern Colorado called _The Citadel_. \n\nNine years since a viral outbreak swept across the southern United States of America in an unprecedented epidemic. \n\nNine years since you were shut in and the world was shut out.\n\nSaying life is different now would be a gross oversimplification of the situation. You left your life behind. Loved ones. Places. Things. You left behind a part of yourself. For most they have lived two lives; life above ground before lockdown and life underground after. \n\nThere is little comfort now. You have shelter and you have air to breathe and occasionally a bite to eat and stinking water to drink but things have reached a point of miserable desperation and everyone knows it.\n\nIt's different than it was when you first came to this place. You bought into the dream of survival. Bought into a survivalist time-share scheme so you could secure a place in a private bunker facility. A place for those with the wherewithal to know something terrible was about to happen to the world. How could you have known though that by some twist of fate or divine intervention or something else, you would actually be one of the lucky few at _The Citadel_ during their time-share period when the epidemic occurred? \n\nNine years ago there had been enough food and clean water, fresh air, electricity and other luxuries to keep you and yours alive for a long, long time here. _Forty years_ Jack Lakota, the owner and developer had said dourly. _The Citadel is setup so twenty-five people could live in there for forty years._ That's what he'd said. \n\nBut it had only been nine years and you are starving. Everyone is starving. The air in the bunker is stale and the purification system needs constant maintenance. The wastewater pumps have all failed. Electricity is rationed, with the generators running as much as three hours every third day, and one hour a day otherwise. The water is salty and tastes of chlorine and people are starting to weaken and get sick, and _die_. \n\nAs a matter of fact in the nine years since you've been locked down, eleven of the original twenty-three people in _The Citadel_ have died. \n\nAll you know about the reasons you were locked in is there was a viral outbreak of some kind, possibly ebola though that's only conjecture. Whatever it was struck hard and there was a frenzy of rioting and violence in the days preceding the decision to lock-down. \n\nThe Citadel has been under military control under the leadership of Virginia Sterret, a United States Marine Corp. Captain ever since the decision was made to lock it down. A few days after that call was made the communication center at the bunker went down. The surface level compound had been attacked by desperate looters who had destroyed defences there including killing several soldiers and damaging the communication tower. The hatch remained sound and Sterret has kept it that way ever since.\n\nAs no cellular or other communication devices were allowed in _The Citadel_ contact with the outside world was lost. As were the rules, the civilians left their devices with the warrant officer in the primary storage lock-up on entry. They could pick them up on leaving but how could anyone have known that day would never come? How could they have known that when the wastewater pumps failed it would cause the sewage lines to fill and eventually the weight of those lines caused the pipes to rupture? How could they foresee that release of filthy water would collapse the ceiling of the corridor that connected the rest of the facility with primary storage? \n\nAnd now, though the fences have all been fixed and reinforced and there has been a vigorous effort by the survivors to build greenhouses and plant and grow fruit and vegetables in the compound, the harvest has been small. Everyone works and helps out; does their part. That's the rules. Though the civilians have been up to the surface they have not been outside the fence and can only see treetops and the sky above the riot barricades and concertina-wire wrapped, ten foot tall chain-link fence. \n\nMilitary patrols outside the fences have brought back some food and supplies they managed to scavenge but they don't talk about the state of the world outside. Whatever the state of things there's not enough to go round. _Too many mouths to feed._\n\nIt's no secret the military have been meeting and discussing things in secret and casting sidelong looks at the civilians. They don't speak openly about their patrols, only saying things like \"it's not safe outside the fence\" or \"you'd never make it down Ute Mountain\" when asked. Its also no secret that relations between the two parts of the same group have been fractious. Though Capt. Sterret is a taciturn leader she has thus far proven firm but fair in most dealings. The rationing of food, water and medical supplies has been difficult but she's developed a system that works. \n\nAll in all its a fucking miracle you've survived this long but you know things are reaching a point where survival at _The Citadel_ will be impossible for everyone and know that something must be done, and soon. But What?",

        "comment": "#Truth#\n\nTruth is a problem. \n\nThis truth is a thing that can't be denied and can't be changed. Not anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s all left bare now. No secret stores; no vaults of riches, no reserves, no treasures to plunder. Not down here. What you see is what you get. You can write what you want. You can think and you can say what you want. But the truth doesn\u2019t care. If your situation is fucked up, well then that\u2019s just what it is. It\u2019s not anything else so why pretend like it is? Don\u2019t try to dress it up none; make it pretty. It is what it is. \n\nIf we run out of food and water we all die. That's it. That's the truth. And _it is what it fucking is._\n\nCaptain Virginia Sterret, or the lingering wraith that had once been her sat hunched over at a military field desk looking over her own scrawled writing. Column by column, row by row, going down the list in silence. Well, silent except the occasional whispered murmur as she read over something particularly vexing. The skitter of her pen as she tossed and rolled it across the desk only to pick it up a moment later. \n\nSilent except for that.\n\n\u201cPudding, banana.\u201d she said, scoffing; the tip of her pen hovering over the entry. She looked at the total again. \u201cThirteen units\u201d \n\nShe repeated it in her head. _Thirteen._\n\n_Holy fuck. Last thirteen. Almost all gone. Chas is going to fucking love that._\n\nThat was hardly the worst news on the page though. Line after line had been crossed off the list entire. Drawn to zero then scratched out. Forever probably. She used her scaling rule to do it. Laid it across the page and drew a long, straight, horizontal red line right through each field, left to right. Military precision. \n\nDone. \n\nGone. \n\nForever. \n\nNever again would they have Soup, gumbo chicken or Corn, whole kernel sweet, or Tuna, chunk light. Nope. Those were just distant memories now. Instead they had vital staples like Beans, kidney, red, (71 units) and Raisins, golden, seedless (114 units) and her personal favorite Sea Vegetables, kelp, wild Atlantic kombu (37 units).  They had rice too, and oatmeal and cornmeal. There was no more coffee, but they had tea. There was no more dried pasta, but there was peanut butter. A little left. Two units. \n\n_Fuck._ \n\nShe'd missed that one. Thought there was more. Virginia liked peanut butter. She was going to miss it. Jesus Christ she was going to miss it! \n\nThe white light from the LED camping lantern was dimmed by a piece of brown paper she had wrapped around it as it shone down from the filing cabinet on her left, deepening and darkening the pockets where her eyes should have been, accentuating the worry lines and sallow cheeks. \n\nShe hated the ledger. Hated the dark burgundy, faux leather textured cover, hated the gilt edge, elaborately tooled in gold, hated the smooth, thin, black ribbon connected to the spine which she used as a bookmark to keep her place. \n\nShe\u2019d tried to delegate this part. Shift this responsibility to someone else. Hell, she\u2019d even been successful. Lasted a year. Then Danny blew his fucking brains out and that was that. \n\nShe was pretty sure it hadn\u2019t been the ledger that\u2019d caused him to put the muzzle of his Sig Sauer in his mouth and squeeze off two shots into the soft tissue of his palate. There was some measure of certainty that it was mostly the bleak reality of their life under the mountain, at the end of the world, trying to make honey out of dogshit that had done that. Still. The ledger was terrible. It was all truth, and it was all bad. \n\nTwo shots. \n\nDetermined. \n\nShe guessed that second squeeze had been all reflex and not grim resolution though. \n\n\nHe\u2019d painted the silver-white tiles of the bathroom stall in streaks of brightest red and ribbons of grey and shards of bone-white, and all she could think was she was going to have to get on that fucking ledger again. Fucking ration duty. _Tooth-to-tail, soldier. Tooth-to-tail._\n\nDanny had been fond of saying he didn\u2019t have the recipe for turning dogshit into honey. He\u2019d say that when he\u2019d report on their diminishing supplies. When she'd look at him wanting a different answer about how much of any one thing they had left. She\u2019d always thought Danny was better at it than her. At rationing. At crunching the numbers. Mostly she just hated this part more than anything else. But here she was. All hers again.\n\nShe flipped the page. \n\n_Vegetables._\n\nGod, those had been a saving grace. \n\n_Collards, potatoes, leeks, carrots, cabbage, peas, broccoli._ \n\nBeautiful. Fresh. Delicious. All of them. \n\nThe herbs had all died. Shame that. That smell of fresh dill, and basil. Sweet, sweet basil. They\u2019d even planted cilantro and parsley, but none of it had survived. She\u2019d looked forward to the enrichment of flavoring in their food the herbs would have provided. They\u2019d dried some. She didn\u2019t know how much was left. She didn\u2019t count that. \n\nBuilding the greenhouses out of old shower stall doors and rolls of plastic and salvaged lumber. That had been something. That had given them a new purpose, and a new hope. That had been good. They had some ideas on how to do it better too; things they could do different next year. In the spring. Next year. Year ten. \n\nShe took a deep breath. Let it out, practically a whistle. \n\nThere hadn\u2019t been enough vegetables though. There was never enough. There was never going to be enough. Less and less each of the three years they\u2019d planted. Colder winters, drier summers. \n\nShe\u2019d crunched the numbers. It was all in front of her. Total survivors. Military. Civilian. Their ages, their health stats. Remaining food stores at current ration levels. They wouldn\u2019t make winter. Not all of them. No fucking way. \n\nTruth.\n\nShe pulled the dark-rimmed glasses from the end of her nose and tossed them onto the desktop. A tiny knot of bulging veinery at her temple. \n\nHer eyes closed, elbow propped on the desktop. Forehead in palm, head hanging.\n\n\u201cFuck you Danny.\u201d"

That way and not some other way.\u201d_\n\n\u2015 Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian\n\n---\n\n[Music: Deportation/Iguazu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_aaahw06jw)\n\n[Music: Alma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQWGomAbns)\n\n---\n\nThe church stood mutely; shrouded yet in the long shadows of morning for the sun had not yet risen so high as to warm Sentinel just yet. But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill.\n\nNo horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. \n\nThe town was empty. Abandoned. \n\nSentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. \n\nLater Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. \n\nThe Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel.\n\nThey built. \n\nBut the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. \n\nAnd the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. \n\nThe Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. \n\nThe settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today.\n\nAnd it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above,  raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesa\u2019s spire. \n\nIn the dusty town its streets lay bare and it's windows and doorways were haunted by expectant shadows. \n\n---\n\n_Scene notes:_\n\n_I've set the opening scene up so as to be a bit vague, where you each get to decide where in Sentinel your character awakens by selecting and playing a card against one of the Starting Location challenges. You all start in different locations of town, but will meet up shortly. I will trigger the event that causes the characters to meet up after everyone has had a chance to introduce their character._\n\n_**Map**_\n_See the map [here](https://imgshare.io/image/BVK4P) for more information._\n\n_**Reference Photos**_\n_View reference photos of Sentinel and the great mesa [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/613062138378059848/700834378124754975/702218695702872175)._\n\n_**Starting Location Challenges**\nRead these carefully, though they are similar, they are not all treated equally. How you resolve the challenge not only determines how close your characters are to one another at the start, but also determines the possessions your character starts with. _\n\n_**Asset: Possessions Cards**\nMake sure you read the outcome of your starting location challenge carefully as they dictate some details for what possessions you start with. You will either rewrite the asset card with a description of your belongings or you will discard the stack completely if you are starting with nothing. Please make your items narratively interesting over tactically advantageous. The Asset card is literally just meant to be your equipment list and will not actually be played in a challenge. _\n\n_Unless it says otherwise, you will start with whatever clothing you decide your character will have. You may also have a personal weapon, a knife and/or a pistol and ammunition, some money and other minor items. Please write these in when you rewrite the card._\n\n_**Goals**_\n_The available cards are first come, first serve. You must take one of the Goal Cards available, either **You Have A Secret**, or **You Had A Bad Night**._\n\n_I created these goals as a way to establish some early distrust between your characters. Your characters should start as uneasy strangers who decide to stick together because there's strength in numbers or because they're all in the same boat, or maybe some other reason altogether. I'll leave it to you to decide._\n\n_In your opening post please introduce your character. Take it as far as them waking up and looking around at their surroundings. You may take some liberties on the descriptions of the locations where you wake up, but for the opening post I just want to get a glimpse at who your characters are and get you each established in the world before grouping up._\n\n_If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to ask here: [Link](https://discordapp.com/channels/613062138378059848/699822674226184242/703647347208486963)_"

Elements of both will be tweaked and made to suit what we're trying to do. \n\nFirst and foremost you need to understand that Ten Candles is a tragic horror game. Your character is going to die in this one. No ifs ands or buts. \n\nAs designer Stephen Dewey wrote: \n\n_\"The middle of a sunless apocalypse. The sky has darkened  and turned against you. Satellites have gone quiet, leaving  you without solar power, cell phones, internet, GPS, and many other luxuries that the world has grown accustomed to. Power grids have failed on a global scale against the demand and the world has been left in darkness. And now, They have come. It is uncertain what They are, but  They\u2019re out there in the dark, and They\u2019re coming for you.\"_\n\n_Ten Candles is not a game about \"winning\" or beating the monsters. Instead, it is a game about what happens in the dark and about those who try to survive within it. It is a game about being pushed to the brink of madness and despair, searching for hope in a hopeless world and trying to do something meaningful with your final few hours left._\n\nIf you have any inclination that you want to contradict this, or propose a way that your character can survive, don't. That's not the goal here. \n\nIf you are interested in applying I invite you to take part in the planning conversation taking place on slack at the link below:\n\n**Ten Candles-Storium Slack**\nhttps://storium-chat.slack.com/messages/CBHRE7W00\n\n---\n\nOther helpful links\n\n**Ten Candles Website**\nhttp://cavalrygames.com/ten-candles/\n\n**Google Share Files**\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1t_iLk8GUZ-lX3UcxqmccOQbaQ67FPQwp",

Maybe eleven. I can\u2019t be certain. \n\nI\u2019ve been busy staying alive. Drinking water from gutters and eating rotten bananas. Used to hate those. If they had even a few little brown spots I would throw them out. Now I can\u2019t peel them fast enough. \n\nI\u2019ve been hiding. Trying to keep myself sane. Or at least rational. My phone is dead now but I'm still carrying it. All my pictures are in there. All my videos. My emails. Contacts. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I am anymore. Sane I mean. Being rational in the face of something like this is the definition of insanity. So yeah, it's been hard to tell how long its been since _they_ came.\n\nNo sun anymore. No moon or stars either. No tide. All the seabirds have come inland. I hear them among the buildings. Think they know when it's supposed to be day somehow. Some old instinct. I don\u2019t know if that's true or not or if I'm thinking about some other animal. I'd google it but....\n\nI think about them. The birds. About wings. Think about if I had wings. If I could fly away. About going up into that unending blackness and seeing how far out to sea I could go. If I would reach land. Could I get beyond this black veil? Maybe it's not everywhere. Not yet. I could fly somewhere better, where there are still people. Or maybe I would just fly as high as I could. Up where the air was thin and cold and where I could stop and fall forever. \n\nStrange to think about but I might have been happy before this. Life wasn\u2019t what I thought it should be, but it was something. A lot of it spent  living. They don\u2019t tell you that. That laundry and buying groceries and paying bills will take up so much of your life. How much time all that busy work robs from you. Never dawned on me I could be happy in that. \n\nThe difference couldn\u2019t be clearer now. This is hell on Earth. I\u2019ve tried to stop myself from crying at night. I know there\u2019s no chance of ever feeling alright again though so I weep and I can\u2019t stop.\n\nAlways thought it was better to be independent. To be alone. To push people away and keep a safe distance. They\u2019ll only hurt or disappoint you. That's what I used to tell myself. I was comfortable in silence. Able to be by myself. I craved it. Craved being alone. In my thoughts. In my own little world. Being around other people drained me. Like they were taking something from me but in solitude I felt like I was rebuilding my soul or my mind or whatever. It energized me.\n\nI\u2019ve told myself the way I\u2019m feeling now is a survival mechanism. My overpowering desperation to find someone else, to be with someone else. That it\u2019s hard-wired in humans to group up with others when there\u2019s a disaster and they\u2019re threatened. Strength in numbers and all that. But I'm beginning to think maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was always this way. All that touchy-feely nonsense about needing human contact. About how social support and social interaction has a positive influence on a person's' physical and mental well-being. I think maybe all that stuff was true. \n\nI guess it was easier to not believe that back then. To lump everyone together as disposable. To not want them because I am unwanted. \n\nAm I?\n\nI pushed him away. Oh God. I made it impossible for him to love me. I know I did. Tested him. Pushed him to his breaking point. Tried to prove I didn\u2019t deserve love. When I found out...when it was clear to me it wasn\u2019t a mistake I felt desperate to be with him and to share what was going to be. It scared me to want that so much. But I doubled down. Didn\u2019t tell him. Sick game. I attacked the parts of him he had left vulnerable to me and when he had enough of course he left. What else could he do? He deserved so much better than that. We both did. \n\nWe all did.\n\nThere is no one else. I\u2019m the last one. It makes me writing this even more pathetic. I\u2019ve listened long to the blackness. Hoped for a gunshot or a scream in the distance but there\u2019s nothing. Not anymore. There\u2019s no-one. I\u2019m the last.\n\nWon\u2019t look at the picture in my pocket. Can\u2019t throw it away either. I don\u2019t know what that says about me.\n\nUp here there\u2019s a depth to the darkness. Almost like there\u2019s a light somewhere beyond it. My mind\u2019s way of tricking me. Some last attempt to rekindle hope. But it's getting colder and my arms and legs don\u2019t have the strength to climb back down now. I won't stay here. I can't. I need to go. \n\nIf only I had wings .\"\n\n---\n\nThe island resort has turned into a nightmare. The beach sand has turned so thick with blood that not even the tide can wash it away.

This was followed by Washington demanding Austerity measures which saw many police, fire department and other city workers laid off. The Son of Sam was terrorizing the City, having slain six and wounded seven others since the summer of 1976.

        "comment": "#The Tombs#  \n\n_125 White Street_\n_Manhattan Detention Complex (MDC)_\n\nThe MDC is a municipal jail in an area known as the civic center of Lower Manhattan. \n\nIts granite walls are made from stones salvaged from Bridewell Prison after that center of incarceration ceased to be in 1838, one hundred and three years after its building.\n\nBridewell was a British prison built to house American prisoners of war. It had barred windows open to the elements and was a dreadful place; a fact the guards at the MDC used to like to point out to prisoners who complained about the current conditions at the MDC. \n\nEven so, there was a lot worth complaining about. \n\nFirstly, it was designed to house some 900 inmates but by 1969 was housing over 2000. \n\nIt sat above an old freshwater cistern, once a primary water source for the city, but long abandoned due to pollution from industrialization. In the years since its building the MDC had settled so extensively that large cracks had formed in foundations and walls. Some floors had heaved or collapsed and were abandoned in ruin, so high was the cost to repair them and so dangerous the work to do so. Many had complained about deep rumblings from beneath the building and foul-smelling odors rising from the fissures and rents.\n\nIn 1974, less than a month after a riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica New York caused the deaths of ten correctional officers and civilian employees as well as thirty-three inmates, most of The Manhattan Detention Center was abruptly closed. An exodus of some 350 inmates went to Rikers Island with the rest forced to stay in a gutted and hollow shell of the prisons former self. \n\nThe reason for the closure was outwardly cited as structural concerns. It was however widely believed a known inability to quell an organized riot was the real reason they shut it down. \n\nOne ward remained. \n\nIn an old annex with 144 cells, more than a hundred of which now sat unoccupied, was a section dubbed the Special Inmate Containment Center (SICC). Forty-one inmates remained in this run-down but technologically advanced prison ward. \n\nFollowing some notable escapes from the prison a think tank of engineers, architects and other prison design specialists decided a specialized ward to house the _\u201cremarkably criminally capable\u201d_ was required. People with a penchant for escape, those with an affinity for lock-picking or slipping through narrow spaces or making them, as well as those able to manipulate corrections officers and civilian workers into assisting in their plans. These were the people now housed at what was left of the SICC.\n\nThe SICC had state of the art locks and containment cells, requiring a pair of directly operated manual locks and remotely operated electronic tumblers be unlocked simultaneously in order to open a cell or ward door. \n\nThe SICC employed staff who underwent rigorous psychological evaluations and were paid exceptionally well for the work they did. They enjoyed coveted positions within a legal system that had seen the city\u2019s police and correctional facility staff diminish over previous years. It was bragged that _\u201cthey couldn\u2019t be bought\u201d_.\n\nThere was only one way out of the prison now and that was up through the main guard tower between the two wings of the SICC. There were three sets of security doors to get through just to get into the guard tower. From there you had to go by an open stairwell or cargo lift with armed guards in riot gear on all sides up four stories to another containment area that had another two security doors to get through before opening up at the Bridge of Sighs. This enclosed concrete causeway crossed over White Street and connected to the now abandoned Criminal Courts Building. \n\nBy 1977 there had been another long-standing name used for the place. One that hearkened back to the stones from which it was built. They called the MDC, and specifically the SICC portion of it _the Tombs_. From the outside the reason for this seemed to be the fact it had been built in the Egyptian Revival style with grand round or square columns and an overall squarish appearance with tall, narrow arched windows and obelisks. From the outside, the building looked like a utilitarian Egyptian tomb.  \n\nBut there was more to it than that.  \n\nWhen its stones had stood elsewhere as Bridewell, the winter winds had taken the lives of hundreds of ill-fed American patriots who wasted away and expired, unable to find sanctuary from the cold and wind, their fight for independence concluding piteously in a British prison on what would eventually become sovereign American soil. It was long believed that the dead haunted the halls of The Tombs, and in the years since its closure since much of the facility had been left decrepit and falling apart and empty these whispered stories only grew more intense. \n\nThe usual fare of haunted places. Strange sounds coming from abandoned corridors. The sighting of apparitions, objects misplaced and deemed to have been taken by supernatural entities. \n\nSo widespread were these stories by inmates and facility staff alike that several medical and psychological investigations had been undertaken with varying results over the years. In some cases stress was blamed for the sightings. In others, they believed it was the idle complaints of otherwise bored inmates. Still other investigations concluded the sightings were a byproduct of _\u201cchronic exposure to methane, hydrogen sulphide, and formaldehyde within the aging prison complex\u201d_. \n\nBut exposure to toxins from a polluted subterranean well didn't explain missing inmates. \n\nBad press aside it was easier to rule these as escapes but in some cases these were model inmates with little time left before the end of their sentence. \n\nAnd what about the suicides? In the months leading up to the summer of 1977 there had been twelve of those. Three of which had been prison guards who had gone into abandoned parts of the prison and there either cut both their wrists and throat with a straight razor or shot themselves in the head or face. \n\nThe inmates had used various methods as well and one of those who had survived said afterward that a man dressed in white came to his cell and told him to do it. That the end was coming and that he didn't want to be around for it. So persuasive had this man in white's story been that the inmate had wrapped the leg of his prison issue pants around his neck and tried to strangulate himself from his bed rail.\n\nWhether you believed it or not there was something to the rumors about The Tombs that you could not shake. Something dark and malign that seemed to hunker in those old shadows and darkened halls. Something that seemed to be reaching out and taking people."

One such endeavor of mans perseverance was the Eden Project. \n\nThe Eden Project was the brainchild of Cormorant Technology, a group of like-minded scientists and visionaries who dreamed that through the technological advancements made in the second half of the twenty-first century there could be found a way to catalog the biological resources of the world, a sort of genetic archive for use in stabilizing the earth\u2019s climate, its populace and its flora and fauna in the event of what many believed were *numerous imminent unavoidable global ecological disasters.*\n\nBy December of 2061 their accomplishments include completed database mapping of all Human and Animal Genomes, perfection of nanofabrication technology, construction of a dozen massive artificial biome complexes around the world and development of a voluntary cryonic preservation program. \n\nPart of this initiative involved human volunteers willing to enter cryonic stasis and be virtually archived so that one day they might serve as ambassadors to their own descendants, to be a face of man's history; people who truly understood the worlds challenges in the time before the great disasters. \n\nVolunteers for the cryonics program came from all walks of life, all ages, all races and genders. The first volunteers were awarded lucrative signing bonuses that benefited their families and so many of these came from the lower and middle class. As the state of the world worsened people began to see the Eden Project as a way to live a better life, to awaken in a better future and in some cases it gave them a great sense of purpose. \n\nThe term \u201ccryoneers\u201d is coined in reference to these brave souls willing to undergo the cryonic stasis process in the hopes that they may one day be reborn.\n\n----\n\n**2207**\n\nRevived from stasis over one hundred and forty years after entering cryosleep, you have awoken in an unknown derelict underground facility but it is not the one you remember. \n\nAfter leaving your cryopods you will begin to make your way through the crumbling science facility. Along the way you will find layers of dust over everything, signs of sabotage; evidence that there had been violence at some point while you all slept. \n\nWhat is the state of the world? Why weren't you revived sooner? Where are the Cormorant science and medical staff that should have greeted you on revival? \n\nThese questions and others drive your characters in their bid for answers and a route to the surface.\n\n**Expectations**\nThe world that Eden Project takes place in is at times dark, gritty, bleak and horrifying and influences have been drawn from The Thing, Half-Life, Dead Space, True Detective, Alien, Eden Log, Sunshine and Event Horizon among many others.\n\nI am looking for players who are comfortable playing believable, real-world characters in a near future sci-fi setting. I require players who will work to integrate their characters backgrounds, personalities and motivations into the narrative and experience of the game. \n\nThe plot is flexible depending on the actions of the players and their characters.\n\nWrite in 3rd person, omniscient past-tense only. \n\nYou will write only for your own characters perspective and not take liberties on other peoples characters, including mine (NPCs).\n\nSuperhero and cliche sci-fi tropes will not be considered. \n\nYou should be a proactive player, co-operative and willing to have your character face adversity from the world and its inhabitants, as well as from the other characters at times as fits the story. \n\nCustom cards are required - I want to get an idea of the type of player you are before we start. \n\n\n*If you have any questions contact me at:* **nautilus_project@hotmail.com**",

        "comment": "The abyss.\n\nA vast, endless gulf.\n\nOblivion in its purest form.\n\nA place of nowhere and nothing within which consciousness lingered dormant for an unmeasured span unaware even of itself.\n\nThis was both a foreign and a familiar state of being. It was like a long, deep slumber and it was like death. Once given over to this inert state you did not relinquish easily the perfect peace of it. Yet though your mind may be dormant and senseless and unable to comprehend, there was something else in the immeasurable hollow within which your mind had been so long held captive; a deeper darkness - an even greater gulf beyond the proximal black. In the absence of sentience you had no fear of it; no concept of what it was or what passing through its threshold might mean, the finality of what you would leave behind. You were in fact not even aware it existed.\n\nThe infinite calm was pierced by a shrill, inhuman resonance. The noise mercilessly tore you away from that dreamless sleep on the precipice of nowhere, rhythmically swelling, stabbing into your brain with its arrogant, self-important persistence. For long moments your human shell remained motionless. Your mind was unable to comprehend the reality that languidly, painfully seeped back into your extremities. The stark disparity between the urgency of the sound and the lassitude of your flesh and mind would be unbearable if you had the sense to compare them.\n\nWhat started as a tingling sensation in your toes and fingertips soon escalated a thousand-fold. Your body was wracked by involuntary convulsions; your flesh and muscle burned with a million pinpricks of excruciation. You would shriek if you could but control of your body was not your own and save the tremors and convulsions you were frozen; immobile. Instead, your senses failed you again. The shrill bleating noise abated. The darkness returned.\n\n*Sleep now.*\n\n*Let the world die.*\n\n*Sleep forever.*\n\nThe new blackness that threatened to engulf you was beyond the sort one would normally associate with the word; it was the umbral, total non-existence of light that occurred only within the desolate space of an utter void. Your mind was going home to that ocean in the black gulf beyond the world, once again aimlessly floating in the soft current of that languid abyss, your awareness departing; going back to its deactivated state\u2026.but your consciousness lingered on the verge; reluctant to plunge in; to fall from the edge and disappear. Your mind was now suddenly becoming aware of the darkness and of the yawning chasm beyond it that would engulf you and take you into eternity. Your ability to comprehend that it even existed was infinitely more stimuli than you had been capable of processing for a very long time and you could not ignore it. Half-heard whispers and promises echoed in your mind; persuading you to let go and to freefall deeper and flee this harsh reality which was tugging at you. Even though you would relinquish your consciousness gladly in trade for the comfort of the now fleeing abyss, your body would no longer acquiesce. It would not again be stifled. \n\nIt wanted to live.\n\nLight pierced the obsidian night that had been all you had known for so long and you recoiled from its piercing, brilliant, blinding emission. Your eyes opened. Abruptly you were aware of movement all around you and though it took several moments more you eventually sensed there was a viscous fluid on your body, covering you \u2013 enveloping you . It took you a long while after that to realize that the movement was actually pockets of air; bubbles floating in the cloudy fluid that surrounded you \u2013 the fluid you were suspended in. Though the notion of it didn\u2019t cross your mind and it had seemed only a moment between the first and this period of waking - much time had passed without your cognizance since the rhythmic screeching sound had first invaded your slumber. How much had passed, you could not have guessed even if your mind had been working and curious about such things and you had wished to. Had it been seconds, minutes or hours? Could it have been days? Weeks? Longer? The question went unasked.\n\nNow all was silent save a droning hum and the sound of the fluid in your ears and the almost tidal rhythm of the passage of air into the rubber and plastic oxygen mask attached to your face. You felt your cranium, forehead and ears were covered by a mesh-like rubber cap and that you was naked, swathed in strips of white, fibrous membrane held together by gelatinous bands and covering your entire body. There was a web of thin white tubes suspended in the fluid that entwined your limbs, tapping into your wrists, neck, chest, legs and ankles and running out to a panel on the side of the pod. Pulpy strands of fleshy, fibrous material float in the gel all around you; hanging from the tubes, nearly clogging the various apparatus.\n\nWhere the needles pierced your flesh you could see raised, purply welts and feel a tingling, burning pain. Various fluids moved through the white tubes connected to the syringes and into you and all at once you began to struggle against the confines of the tank. Before you were fully aware or could consider the repercussions of your actions you pulled at the needles, painfully dislodging several from your flesh. Immediately, a shrill ringing sound began to echo in your ears; reminiscent of the noise that had assailed you and pulled you back from the precipice of the endless drop-off before. As you moved you felt pressure in your lower back and groggily reached down to jerk a long sliver of metal from your spine there. Hot pain in your lower extremities. It passed soon enough; so did consciousness.\n\nWas that a woman\u2019s voice you could hear murmuring mutely above the sound of the dull bleating noise of the alarm? \n\n*Who is that?*\n\n*What are you saying?*\n\nYou regained consciousness on the floor of the pod. A roaring rush of fluid all around signaled its evacuation and you were aware of the suction of a drain somewhere by one of your legs. Suddenly, you were deathly cold and simultaneous with the sensation your body began to shiver uncontrollably. After a few moments you heard a mechanical clicking and a sound like pressure being introduced into an air system nearby but there was no other change to your reality. You struggled to regain control of your body, raise your head a bit and try to stop the shaking. It was no use, you were freezing and for your efforts you were soon wracked with convulsions. Then a loud click and the hiss of spraying fluid and you were pelted with a mist of warm water from above. The viscous substance on your flesh was washed away, the cold abated and after a time some of your strength returned. Once the water ceased falling on you, you could sense the ambient temperature in the room beginning to warm.\n\nThe clinging, invasive instruments were next to go. After you had managed to extricate yourself from them and climbed up and out of the tank you found you were still disoriented, nauseous and unable to recall anything that could have led up to this moment. Around your neck you found a thin lanyard strap, and attached to that an ID badge.Your senses and your strength were sapped and it took everything and a long time before you could take a look around the space you were in.\n\nIt was a room of minimalist, utilitarian design. Dim light-tubes glowed with a pitiful white illumination above the rows of angled cryopods along the walls. It was a long room, perhaps a hundred feet in length, narrow down the middle where the cryopods were arrayed and widening at both ends into open rooms that were too dark, and your eyes too bleary to discern with any clarity. The floor of the corridor consisted of pale, olive green, interlocking polycarbonite panels, grated in the center. A fine mesh could be seen in the openings of the grates below. \n\nThe ceiling was adorned with myriad lines and tubes; banks of ducting that ran in dizzying, criss-cross formation to and from the tanks and then along the ceiling and out to other parts of the facility by the looks of it.\n\nHanging next to the cryopod is a thin white robe and a towel; both covered in clear plastic sheeting. \n\nThere were other pods open already, some were just opening and others remained closed altogether."

We had no immunity. Rich countries underestimated its virulence. Small, developing countries didn't have the resources or education and training to stem the tide of infections. The survival rate started low. Lower than the flu. People were recovering. \n\nMeasures were taken. They weren't strict or soon enough in many cases. The infection rate gre. The mortality rate grew. They closed borders. Stopped schools and non-essential workplaces. Just for a while they said. To slow the progress of the disease. At first they expected it to last a couple of weeks. Then it was months. \n\nIt took mostly the old and infirm and the very young at first. Those with underlying health conditions. Smokers and those with cardiovascular disease.  Then, people who had recovered got sick again. And everyone who got sick twice died. \n\nIt affected the healthy, the strong and the able-bodied. There was a desperate scramble for a cure that ultimately met with failure as the civilized world fell into dissolution, its societies failing in the face of cataclysmal population loss. \n\nThings fell apart fast as the mortality rate increased. The power grid failed. Order could not be maintained. Cities and towns burned, were looted, gutted and left abandoned. \n\nSome who lived in remote areas or who managed to find such places afterwwars managed to survive.  In the time that's passed they have had to survive by living off the land, by scavenging and hunting and growing what they could in order to eat. These they called _The Unlucky Few_.\n\nYou are a member of such a group. Having survived the initial outbreak and the time since then you are part of a small farming commune in Grand Junction, Colorado. Your group is made up of a few hardy folk who gathered around the idea of living not only for yourselves but also for one another. \n\nYour farmstead is remote and self sufficient. You get few visitors. A couple of times a year a trader comes through to bring necessities and news of the places they have been in exchange for some of your harvest. A trapper family who lives in the mountains north of you winters at your commune in exchange for furs and meat every year. \n\nThese are your only contacts with the outside world and neither of them bring stories that persuade you there is anything worth leaving your commune for.\n\nYou are harvesting your crops now, readying for the winter. Preparing the buildings for the snow and for the cold, chopping firewood. \n\nEverything you want and need is right here. It is a hard but simple life. You work, you raise livestock, you plant and harvest. You store food for the winter, you watch water levels and annual snow pack. There is peace and prosperity to this life.\n\nBut like all good things this too must come to an end.\n",

        "comment": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. \n\nThere was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves.\n\nErin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. \n\nHer eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. \n\nThe tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horse\u2019s legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp \u201cho\u201d, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. \n\nRed dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. \n\n\u201cPoint of no return, hey Chess.\u201d Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasn\u2019t supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasn\u2019t supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. \n\nThe horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely.\n\n\u201cCome on.\u201d she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. \n\nDown the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. \n\nShe wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasn\u2019t sight-seeing this time and went on. \n\nAt the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. \n\nThe horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them.  It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. \n\nTaking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. \n\nSeeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._\n\nSeventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. \n\nErin knew bighorns didn\u2019t travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. \n\nThere were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. \n\nA quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. \n\nStill. \n\nWhen she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. \n\nShe slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped.\n\nBelow her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. \n\nThere was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. \n\nAnd that wasn't all...\n\n---\n\n*I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. *\n\n*She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers. She's breaking rules and is going to be reprimanded when she gets back.* \n\n*Most likely situation is when Erin reaches the crest of the hill she sees an approaching rider which is your character. Maybe you went out in search of her not knowing where she went after finding her and/or the horse she took missing. Maybe you saw her go and followed her. Do others know you left? Are you breaking any rules by going? You could be planning to bring her back and try to cover for her, or maybe as a disciplinary figure.*\n\n*Whoever it is that goes should establish some sort of deeper relationship with Erin in this scene.*\n\n*Please play against the Erin challenge in one post, and we will follow with the cabin after if you opt to do so. Note the cabin has not been recently explored by either Erin or your character and is a mystery to you both why the door is open and the window broken out. There is no reason for anyone to be at the shack, plus all are accounted for at the commune except Erin.*\n\n*I would like to establish this scene with a few posts before I open it up for everyone who isn't out looking for her. I will let you know when it's wide open for free-for-all posting again.*"
