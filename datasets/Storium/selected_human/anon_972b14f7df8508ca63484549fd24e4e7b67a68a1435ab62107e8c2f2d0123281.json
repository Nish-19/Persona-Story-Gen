        "comment": "# Chaotic Good It was just about, but not quite, evening as a man and a woman sat at the window counter of a Starbucks. [**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. \"It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin\", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, \"And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'...\" He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. \"They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!\", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. \"Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...\", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. \"**Stop** right there, put down those die!\", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, \"Nobody touch *anything* on that table!\""

        "comment": ">*A figure in a bathrobe and a striped bucket hat approached an old, dusty Gramophone. It blew some of the dust away and put on a record. Lowering the needle and letting it play.* >** # The Library at the End of the Universe The Great Library, true to its name, was *big*. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it was. I mean, you may have thought it was a long way down the block to Starbucks, but that was just *peanuts* to the Great Library. Aside from books, and many many other different things, the main things that the Great Library was home to, were the Chronicle, and of course, the Librarians. The Chronicle was a special book. For one, it was bigger than all the other books, had its own lit up pedestal in the exact center of the Great Library, and most importantlyit was *blank*. Off-white, blank, pages, with not a drop of ink in sight, housed inside an ornate, glowing, golden cover. The only times that the Chronicle's pages filled with explosive, colorful illustrations, were when a *Bookworld* had strayed from its written *story* and needed a little bit of help getting back onto its true path. And the ones that the Chronicle sent into these Bookworlds were the Great Library's faithful keepers; the Librarians. However, for all of its greatness, the Great Library always seemed to be in a state of *suspension*. It was hushed and quiet for the most part, aside from any noise, or music, or cheerful shouting or the desolate sobs of the Librarians occupying it. And the air around it --unless disturbed by the Librarians-- was still. Little dust motes always seemed to hang in the air no matter which way you turned or how much you fanned them off, they always seemed to be there, glittering in the light coming from the stained glass windows. Windows, that only ever seemed to let in *two* kinds of light. Always, every day, it was either **dawn** or **dusk** in the Great Library, and never anything else. Somehow, the Librarians always knew to wake up a little before dawn, and go to bed (or pretend to go to bed, or sit and read for hours) after dusk. Speaking of the Librarians, when they weren't off traversing Bookworlds, and pretending to be great detectives, or mermaids, or princes, or super heroes, they spent the rest of their time in the Great Library. Because besides the endless, dust covered shelves, little coffee tables and red, ornate armchairs, steaming ceramic tea pots around every shelfit also had *rooms*! Many different rooms, each found as one walked around the maze of shelves for some indeterminate amount of time, until one stumbled upon the exact room that they needed. Be it a kitchen, or bedroom, or bathroom.even a play room and a gym! If a Librarian needed a certain room, the Chronicle made sure they had access to it. And in much the same way, the Great Library had sections! The Sci-Fi section of the library was a little more techy, even providing access to computers and video games, the Fantasy section had real, live trees, and flowers, and vines, along with little magical creatures that inhabited it, and so on and so forth. In all, the Great Library was an enigma. Suspended in space, housed in between times, containing an all powerful, and yet completely unassuming Chronicle.it was more than the Librarians' home. It was their *world*. And as their world, it was also their *story*. And since all stories have a beginning, this one did to. It was *dawn*."

A sword that can take not only lives, but **souls**.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VogWfA4zesA)\n\n\n*Long long ago, in ancient Japan, there said to have existed a mysterious clan of assassins known as The Ministry. Skilled beyond their years and more powerful than the strongest samurai, they were known only to a certain few but their influence spread to many. They worked in the shadows to keep the peace and maintain a balance in the world.*\n\n*Among their ranks, usually the leader, wielded a very powerful weapon; a katana forged from the strongest and sharpest metal. It was passed down from Master to Student and was said to possess certain mystical and supernatural powers.*\n\n*This weapon, known as **Life Drainer**, fed on human souls. The one who received the sword into their possession had to give up their soul to the sword and over time pay off their debt. Each life the sword took, it absorbed that soul into itself, giving back the wielder a sliver of their own. Only after the entire debt was paid and the wielder's trapped soul retrieved, Life Drainer had to move on to a new owner.

And most have come to forget and abandon the little cafe which just half a year ago served them free coffee with side of smiles. \n\nAmong the new faces and new regulars, however, a select few have stayed and kept coming back. Some out of solidarity, bittersweet memory...and some out of necessity. \n\nThe damage may have been done and the blood and the brains have long been wiped off the counters, but the little coffee shop by Central Park still had a part to play and a destiny to fulfill...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Coffee Nutz crew this week consisted of the Russian and perpetually angry-looking [**Sonya**]( the totally not high or anything college dropout [**Stevie**]( and of course the new owner Nathan \"Nate\" (or Mr. Gray) himself. Nate was currently in the back, going over his *other* store's supply, y'know, the illegal, *more* addicting kind? The other two employees were well aware of Coffee Nutz moonlighting as Nate's personal drug ring. Sonya didn't exactly approve of it, but she didn't exactly care enough to raise objections. And Stevie? Well lets just say that half of Stevie's paycheck was not in the form of *money*... Sonya was preparing the first batches for the bakery all while trying to teach poor Stevie some Russian while he stacked cups and prepped the coffee machines. Nate was finishing up packing all the little baggies and pills deep into their respective sacks of coffee, sugar and the like. Away from any prying eyes. \"No. No you say *dobroe utro*\", Sonya enunciated every word as she stacked muffins behind the counter glass. \"D-dobe...roy....\", Stevie actually had to put down the pack of coffee he was feeding the machine to focus up, \"Dobroy....Oot....what was it?\" The Russian woman gave a resolute sigh. \"Why do I bozer?\", she muttered to herself, \"You like my hasband. In ze one ear. Out of ze ozer. *Dob*. *Roe*. *Ut*. *Ro*.\" Stevie gave a whine. If he honestly cared about learning things, he would've stayed in college instead of pursuing a career in ethical hacking. \"Dobe...\" Meanwhile in the storage room near the back, Nate paused near one of the boxes he was packing as he heard a muffled crash come from outside, followed by a light string of curses. It was too early for customers. Front *or* back ones... He walked out through the back door and peeked around the corner, leaning his forearms on the door frame. Oh. It was only *Leon*...again. What a surprise! \"Oy!\", Nate called out to him, \"Freeloader! Stop messin' with my trash cans and make yerself useful, yes? Might score ya a free coffee and muffin!\" Nate tossed Leon a broom. \"Go sweep the front. Look pretty.\", with a grin and a wink, Nate disappeared back inside. As Nate joined his team up front in opening the cafe, Sonya gave their boss a weary look. \"How many *narcos* we get zis time, Gray?\", she said with a raised eyebrow as Stevie took his rightful place at the register. \"With *my* luck?\", Nate looked over as he perched on one of the back tables while picking at a freshly made muffin, \"The whole bloody *lot* of 'em!\" ----------------- ## Meanwhile in Kyoto, Japan. ## High up in a secluded temple. [**Leo**]( the current leader of The Ministry, soundlessly took a seat on the floor next to his sensei. \"She *will* be a part of us once again, Sensei. That I assure you. And the weapon will be passed on to its *rightful* owner. But it will not be an easy task.\", Leo spoke quietly with his eyes closed, keeping to the same quiet and meditative atmosphere as his master. \"Nothing is ever absolute\", came the answer from the old man, \"But there is something to easy your path, something that could...guide your way in your endeavors. That sword, it is not without a partner. *Yin and yang*. There exists another weapon. A sword of *light* to balance out the dark. An opposite to *Life Drainer*.\" Leo tensed up but did not let his surprise show any further than that. He remained silent as the sensei gave a smile. \"In time, my student, you will learn all that you need to know.\" --- *edit: Leo's pic changed.*"

        "comment": "# How (Not) to Start a Pirate Adventure [* Sunoco City, West Virginia, Wasteland. Sunset. You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met."

        "comment": "#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop. A little further down the line of people, stood a big man in an equally as expensive suit with rings peppering his fingers and a chain around his neck. He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes. And when he gets back here with my Twix bar, tell him I will break three fingers on each of his hands and make him type up my daughters school report due tomorrow. And it better be fucking *perfect*, he better have read goddamn To Kill a Mockingbird. Because if I dont see any clear cut similarities between fucking Boo Radley and Finch in there, *then* I will shoot him in the head. Got that? You got all that? If he doesnt have the money by the time I get back, that will happen. Tell him that will happen, alright?, he hung up the phone and shook his head, speaking to whoever was in line behind him, \"Assholes, huh? No respect for ya. No ones got any respect anymore. Fuck... And as the sun was still barely peeking through the skyscrapers during this early morning and as two hapless baristas tried to serve the slowly growing number of people, more and more of our storys main characters started flooding into the coffee shop."
