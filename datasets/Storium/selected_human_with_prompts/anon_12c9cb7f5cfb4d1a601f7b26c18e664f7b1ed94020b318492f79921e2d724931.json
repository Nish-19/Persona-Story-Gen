        "comment": "Crowned by the famous Sky Tower, the city at night was more than just a beacon. It was lit up like it was important. Every light gleamed like a neon star, even the ones for the seedier parts of the city. Like each building was a Christmas Tree. Perhaps it was becoming that way again. *************************************** Jacen: Jacen flew above the tower, banking around the great tower that stood higher than any skyscraper in the city. Using the pull of the updrafts, he allowed himself to glide on the wind, enjoying the feeling. Not many people could enjoy this kind of flight. The freedom to direct and float. Skydivers were nothing more than falling rocks with parachutes. They could never understand true flight. The masks built in receiver picked up a scream from the streets nearby. Jacen headed that way, his ZOOM goggles peering into the darkness, looking for the source of the noise. *************************************** Tasia: Tasia dreamt. She didn't remember dozing off, didn't remember the music she had been listening to, but she did remember she had been reading a very interesting book. She had not even noticed the transition from reality to dream world, even as the worlds became illegible and the music distorted. She was in her apartment and she stood, walking around the kitchen, searching for something. She didn't know what. She then heard screaming and went to her window, pulling aside the curtains. Thousands of people screamed, but she was focused on what was happening to the city, the screaming now the baseline for the horrific vision she saw. The city was aflame, thousands of people running and trampling each other. Tasia was suddenly outside as men, women and children cowered, shadows crossing over them. She felt rain droplets on her, hot and thick and warm and suddenly she realized it wasn't rain at all, but blood. It painted her skin, turning her a reddish pink as it coated her, soaking into her hair. Slowly, it began to rise, getting into her shoes and between her toes. *Dead, they're all dead...they people. They're suffering....* She saw, the blood rising, making the corpses float like something in the Dead Sea. Flies buzzed about and rats and mice clung to pieces of driftwood. The blood was up to her knees, then her chest, the corpses pressing in. Her friends, her family...she tried to scream but then the blood was in her mouth and she was drowning in it all. Tasia awoke with a start, her heart pounding. She felt exhausted. Her dreams were often not that...intense. *************************************** Susan: The phone rang and Susan felt around with her hand as she lay on the couch, the ending credits of the movie she had been watching playing. Trying to focus searching for the location of the ringtone, her fingers finally brushed the plastic case and picked it up slowly, holding it up. The lit up screen said \"No Caller ID\". This didn't bode well. Susan keyed the \"Answer\"button and spoke. \"Hello?\" \"Hello Susan. This is Jack. Your father is here. I need you to come pick him up please.\" Jack said. The burly bear of a man was friendly and personable, but his voice was in the tone where something was bothering him a bit too much. She could guess what. \"Yeah, just give me a few. I'll be down there soon.\" Jacks Bar was one of the many places that her father had taken to drinking at. When she had dressed and made her way down, she entered. Her father was at the end of the bar. He looked like he was extremely drunk. \"I told you no Henry. No more drinks! You've had enough for tonight.\" \"Just give me another. Balance me out.\" Her father was saying. His hands were shaking slightly and he looked about ready to start shouting. A few people were staring, others avoiding staring. Jack turned his gaze her way. \"Hey Susan. Can you help me out here?\" Her father looked up, and embarrassment showed on his face. *************************************** Lucas: Lucas was at the call centre, waiting out the night. He was unsure who would call or when, but sometimes he felt like he was only on call when he really didn't want to be. But he needed the money and any cash was good to have. At least his duplicates didn't need their outfits paid for. *************************************** Connor: In the alleyways of the city, Connor waited. He watched and looked at the people that he had come to know from his life in the dark places. Thugs and criminals, prostitutes, dealers and those that fell in between. Out here, he would find something to do. Some kind of way to make a difference.",

        "comment": "They had fought well, but they had fallen and died about the ancient plateau, symbolizing the fall yet to come. It had almost been sad, to see how far the Monastery had descended in their weakness. Stepping over broken bodies and torn limbs, the woman in the hood stood and faced the edifice, an enormous stone and metal vault that stood over a hundred feet high. Even here, she could feel them, reaching from beyond. Their strength could never be fully contained, only weakened to a trickle. But soon, she would change that...oh yes. Raising a hand, she conjured a violet gauntlet, energy forming runes along it, slowly humming the words of power. \"Xiu. Stop right there.\" The voice said, slow, deliberate, gentle and stern all at once. She turned, seeing him floating there, his eyes giving a soft glow. His crimson cloak fluttered, though there was no wind here, in this wasteland. That was why they chose it so long ago. Xiu Fang slipped her hood back, revealing the porcelain mask covering her face, a replica of her own, though the eyes behind were impossible to see in the black. \"It's Sincaster now.\" \"A little on the nose, don't you think?\" Nolan Crassus said as he drifted to the ground, landing lightly on his feet. \"You have your own alias, isn't that right Lovecraft?\" She asked. \"Touche.\" Looking about at the dead warriors, he sighed. \"I would say that there was still time for you to stop this, but I'd say you've used up your quota on lenience.\" He lashed out, a lash made of energy wrapping around the forearm. \"You know I can't allow you to free them.\" \"Can't \"allow\"? You're asking as if I care what you think. You may be the Guardian of this world, but I'm not your subject.\" She said, slashing out with a blade conjured from air. The lash fell away like the broken strings of a violin and she brought her fist into the centre of the vault. Lovecraft send a burst of energy that sent her sliding back, then interposed himself between her and the vault, raised his hands and making a complicated motion, a mystical shield circling him. She cut through it with a burst of earth circling outwards. He answered by summoning bolts of energy. While the battle occurred, cracks had begun to form, spreading outwards from the space where Sincaster had struck. The magic was doing its work from a single blow. Lovecraft sent her flying backward and turned, raising a hand as he tried to halt the destruction, but then she struck him from behind with a blow of a mystical mace conjured to her hand. The vault cracked, red and green energy spreading from the cracks in bursts of light. He only had a moment to throw up a barrier before the stone burst outward, burying him beneath the rock and metal of a door billions of years old. ************************************* It took time to recover fully. The barrier, a bubble around him, provided both oxygen and protection from the crushing layer of mangled metal and crushed granite. It relied on his concentration though, so he meditated, though his mind was reeling. He had to focus to get out and, bit by bit, he unearthed himself, pushing away the fallen rubble and rising out in the bubble. Alighting on the ground, he dropped the sphere. It was as he feared. She was gone. And the doorway was open, meaning they had escaped. He could rely on the Monastery, but none were as well trained as him. Fang had been one of the greatest students at the temple and she had chewed through the masters set to guard this place like it was nothing. He didn't need monks right now. What he needed now was heroes. SENTRIES ************************************* **EMERY** The \"New Horizons\"Centre was anything but new, but the homeless shelter had received an upgrade thanks to money provided by an anonymous benefactor. As such, there was a deal of renovation being dealt with one wing at a time, expanding and upgrading where they could. Felicity ducked under a scaffolding clear of workers as Emery followed her. They had been looking at the changes and they were enjoying what they saw. Painters had been at work and the hallway smelled of new paint. \"Come on, we have to check this out!\" Felicity said, excited to explore as she took their hand. ************************************* **HENDRICKSON** The gym had a fair number of kids today. It was only the most dedicated or sure that would return for later classes. People made a lot of martial arts, karate and the like, but boxing had something that made it special. Punchdown had been the ultimate shadow boxer. But that had been before his retirement. Well, one of them anyway. He had done a great deal since then. The children, some hyperactive, some attentive, waited for his first words to them.",

        "comment": "STAR WARS GUARDIANS OF PEACE It has been six months since the battle of Lothal. Although the secret weapon of the Empire, THE DEATH STAR, is still months from completion, the Empire is increasing its grip on neighbouring planets to punish the Rebel Alliance for their insurgency. In the Outer Rim, figures such as the Black Sun and the Hutts begin to vie for control of the territories, left to their own devices by the Empire. On the Smugglers Moon of Nar Shadaa, the Hutt Crime Boss, NAKRA THE HUTT, begins his own plans to ascend to greater power... ************************************* NAKRA, MIRAX Nakra knew that people did not like to watch Hutts eat. That is why he usually did when he was doing business. Such as this. Mirax Hoban, a human female and smuggler, stood before his throne as he lifted a steaming fried Nuna leg and tore the meat from it, sucking the bones clean before tossing it aside. Shoving his hand into a nearby bowl of crunchbugs, lifting the chirping creatures into his mouth, ignoring the few which leapt from his large green hand to the floor and onto his thick Krayt-skin vest. \"If Black Sun took your ship, then it is impossible for me to intercede.\" Nakra said after swallowing, patting his belly. \"After all, you were the one who incinerated their cargo, did you not?\" They had at least dropped her off on the Smugglers Moon rather than spacing her. In fact, he was quite pleased with the turn of events. Black Sun and their endless \"vigo's\", lead by that abominable Falleen, Prince Xizor....prince of what? Of secrets and lies? He was glad that their shipment was gone. But now he had to deal with Hoban's arrival as best as he could. \"So, you're asking me for...what, exactly?\" He said. He knew a woman only came to visit a Hutt if she was desperate. With his control over his large portion of the city, she must have had something she had to ask for...and to offer. ************************************* DRAY Drays heart was pounding, but she allowed the strange calm that she could sometimes reach to wash over her body, her mind feeling calmer as she slowly found hand and footholds. It was dark outside, but it was always dark in this place. The only lights on the Smugglers Moon came from the endless neon signs and hologram displays, promising entertainment and enjoyment. For herself, she'd settle for enough money to make it through the week. The palace was large and massive and she clambered up the wall, her blue skinned hands finding imperfections in the rock, as if her hands were lead by magnetic tethers. She had considered, many times, how to handle this. Justifying it to herself. Hutts were loathsome slimy opportunistic bottom feeders. Better to steal from one of them than ten commoners. No one was truly innocent on Nar Shadaa anyway. As she clambered upwards and over the ledge of the large balcony, she felt the slight fatigue pass over her and she took a minute to relax and catch her breath. Something, somewhere in Nakra the Hutts palace, would have to be worth money. And the Hutt would probably never miss it. Pushing through the doors of the upper balcony and finding them unlocked(as no Hutt, nor guard, would expect anyone to make it onto a small platform way up here), she moved through the halls. Up ahead, she smelled before she saw the pair of Gamorrean guards. The green and porcine warriors waddled past, snorting to each other, each carrying a large vibro-axe. Though she thought she could stay ahead of them, she was hoping she could avoid getting the business end of those as she waited until they had moved on. Only when she was sure they were gone did she continue. A large pair of double doors blocked her way now. These ones, however, were locked. ************************************* RAINE The Sullustan had been running for days. Trul Zand had broken his bail conditions, which meant that the local official from Eriadu had wanted him back. Dead or alive, it didn't matter to them. The small, two man freighter that Zand had stolen was also lacking in copilot, weaponry or shields. It made it more than easy to line up the shot with the engines and fire. The back section of the engines blew, fire blossoming as they began to pull into the atmosphere over the planet. However, Zand seemed to be keeping the ship in a good position. He had slowed, but he was not crashing and he directed the ship away from the city and towards the swamps. Laser fire blossomed on either side of Raine's ship, but they were warning shots. Two Krayt gunships, the small starfighter enforcers of the Hutts, were currently at port and starboard. \"Vessel, you are currently firing over unauthorized airspace. Identify yourself!\" the voice on the comms was raspy and he heard the click of the teeth. Klatooinian, most likely, one of the servants of the Hutts. ************************************* KEB-KEB Keb-Keb had heard stories over the years about the Power of the Dark Side, the feel of it, the cold and hate. He had heard of the planet Korriban(sometimes mislabelled as \"Moraband\"by the uneducated), where the Sith Species had come from and had wondered if the world had felt anything like Nar Shadaa did. Every day he walked the streets, he felt the hopelessness, the pain, the sadness... At the very least, there was no Imperial presence here. No officers, no stormtroopers. No Inquisitors. Oh, there were a few ships in orbit, but as long as the Hutts did not engage them, the Empire had no jurisdiction here. A few decades back, the Empire had even had some kind of TIE fighter production factory in space, before an unexplained accident had brought the factory down and it was never replaced. As he turned into the alley to go home, he sensed them. There was an assortment about him, but the Dark Side had clouded their presence...until it was too late to avoid them. A Trandoshan leader, an insectivore Kubaz, a Balosar and a Weequay. They were armed, some with blasters, other with vibroknives. \"Credits and anything you have on you. Now.\" Hissed the Trandoshan. Keb-Keb knew how Nar Shadaa worked. There were no law enforcement, only enforcers getting involved if anything disturbed the Hutts. Even if a blaster went off, nobody would come. He had chosen this world for a reason.",

        "comment": "In a small quadrant of the Omega galaxy, the grey orb of Seref floated. The planet itself was used for mining valuable materials, covered in factories. Miners in heavy suits and rebreathers collected the valuable metals and gases for transportation. Homesteads had sprouted up over the planet, living domiciles that converted the harmful gases into breathable air for their species. The planet was one of the giants that many people considered useless but for profit, with no sentient life. It would be harvested until nothing was left, however long that would take. However, over Seref orbited Serefspace. The giant space station had been created specifically to get the miners away from the drudgery of their existence. Little more than a transport hub at first, over time it had changed. Markets had sprouted up, the bases had expanded. Great satellite towers and tines stretched over the city, sports arena's and gambling hubs(though frowned upon)became a normal staple of life there. LYRA: Lyra had been starving. The last ship she had been with had guessed her disposition and had scanned her. They were decidedly afraid of brainworms, as not all of her species were as moral as her own colony. They had expelled her from the ship and constabulary had tossed her into the sealed prison sector on board Serefspace. The cell was small and uncomfortable, but luckily they didn't have the same behaviour as some worlds. Some would kill a host on sight, but here, they were hoping to starve her out of the hosts head, not knowing it was already too late. Either way, she had made a vow and she couldn't leave the host for too long, even to escape. The suits of the guards were sealed, even if she wanted to make a move on them. She had been ready to give up when she had been provided with food. Oli fruit and fresh baked bread had been left on the windowsill and once or twice, she had spotted a child tearing off, chased by the guards. Her hosts health had returned and the guards had taken another look, scanning her and discovering her body was in good condition, despite the age. She was now being freed, but she only had to glance up to notice the small drone camera keeping watch. One outbreak was too dangerous to risk, it seemed. She then saw the child. The Serefen girl was blue eyed and skinned behind the glass rebreather mask and she smiled up at her. This was the one who had provided her with the food. \"I'm A'li.\" She said kindly and politely. \"My family has invited you to come to dinner. Please, will you come?\" GRYX: The crowds roared as the two Ror'nc's clashed. Gigantic, thrice as large as any human, and armoured in their bodies, with great shells and club like tails and triple horned heads, the two beasts slammed into each other like gigantic rhino's, using the claws and their four front legs to grapple. The blue was winning, its beady eyes hidden behind the metal blinders. Only natural, as the beasts only weak spot. Yellow snarled as it brought its head around, trying to gain purchase. Gryx cursed from the shoulder of captain Apollo. The two had bet on Yellow, seeing it as a better bet. Blue was slightly smaller and seemed to be an immature. \"If that beast wins, we're out five thousand creds....\" Apollo said. The two had made a bet and it could very well be the end of them. But it had seemed like the smart wager at the time. \"Somethings fishy here....\" Amaya, their Selia copilot with her violet skin snorted. \"Why did you take the bet?\" \"It seemed like the good idea at the time. Besides, who would have thought the largest would be losing?\" Apollo cursed again as the Blue slammed its head into the yellows side, sending droplets of dark green blood splattering the arena below. LORDE: \"Ugh, this is horrid.\" Lady Lady Lorde stated when she had first come to Serefspace. But now, she stated \"This is the life!\" In the higher towers of the space station city, she was now immersed in a Serefen Bath, as large as a pool, bubbling like a hot spring and containing her favourite scents, from food perfumes to flowers. It was the luxury suite just for her. Her agent Myloe had convinced her to come to the station to show some goodwill to the \"downtrodden\". The native people of this backwater were being removed from the planets surface for their own good, yet they were complaining of the condition of their living on this station. After finishing her bath, she clad herself in a robe of Salacian silk and exited to the living area. A table of sweetmeats and her foods themselves had been set out, fruits from Nebuzar and Salacian spiced pig. A knock came at the door and the obsequious server Dulo entered. \"My Lady, is everything to your liking? Is there anything I might do to enhance your enjoyment in our humble hotel?\" He asked, his pale flesh sweaty. MUDD: He had only recently arrived at the base, but Pi was far from tired. \"Tired\"was an impossibility given his robotic physiology. Moreover, he was interested in the person who recently had contacted him. Moving through the crowds, passing humped Romids, violet skinned Selia and the robed and masked Bloodfielders, he moved through the streets until he triangulated the bar called \"Ne'uls Place\". Inside, dozens of species laughed, drank and fought, but he was able to find a path of least resistance to the table at the corner. A human sat across from him, flanked by two reptilian Vestets. \"You're Mudd Pi then?\" The human said. Grey haired, older, his face scarred, one ear gone, his left eye squeezed shut. \"Belic Zaar.\" He said, offering a hand as mechanical as Mudd's own. \"Do you drink or eat? I have a lack of knowledge of the robotic. My own innards are still in place luckily.\" He said with a grimace that could have been a grin. DRESDEN: People came, people went. They seemed to move fast in comparison to Dresden and here, surely, there must be SOMEONE he could call a friend. Someone who shared his love of the greatest music of all time. The suit was properly powerful enough to help him survive the vacuum and any other environment and many milled around here and there in the market. There even was a Frog faced Delic selling CD's, Audiosingers and coloured singing birds from Aurios. \"Lost stranger? Not often I see one of your kind out here.\" The Delic said, his slimy spotted skin shiny in the light as he sorted through the stand. \"Are you looking for something in general? Tanalee Tivven's \"Reee'en Silavak\"? Ortis Claronels \"Vree'bubak?\" He stated, peering at Dresden curiously.",

        "comment": "**The Imperium** Year 9002 A.G(After the Guild) House Richese has controlled the fiefdom of Arrakis for centuries, currently in a technological arms race with the planet of Ix. The current Padishah Emperor, Voris III, rules with an iron fist, sending his Sardaukar to deal with truculent planets. However, others begin to wonder if the current ruling should not be changed. The dangers of the volatile monarch have begun to endanger many worlds. ************************************ KAITAN IMPERIAL HOMEWORLD \"Look at him Demelza. Is he not magnificent?\" Reverend Mother Aloren Pompeia said softly, pointing at the man down below. The pair sat in a high box over the ring, a great view over the circular arena. Emperor Voris III had his own ornate seat. Though, Demelza noted, it had been built higher than the rest. She detested these events of bloodsport, but the Emperor loved them and so, members of the Bene Gesserit were expected to attend. The triumvirate of power from the assemblage of the Throne, the Guild and the Sisterhood was essential in keeping the Imperium in line. And so she watched where her teacher pointed. The man was handsome enough. Muscular, but lithe, like a Laza Tiger. He was bared to the waist and bore a half shield. She had considered why they did not allow a full shield for the Sardaukar in the rings, but it became clear soon enough. Representatives of the Landsraad came to the arena's to see blood. Often enough, they only had to say the word and enemies would die from afar. Watching the warrior as he readied his blade, she thought of the bravery of the man. In the Imperium, it took courage to kill a man up close. The Salusan Bull was released. The man had already killed a pair of D-Wolves with relative ease, but the massive bull was another story. Its back was studded with spikes, multiple horns crowned its skull and its multifaceted eyes glittered as it levelled its head at the man below. The matador, if they could be called that, one of the Imperial Sardaukar waved the crimson cape. But the beast was in a great rush to cause harm already. The Emperor had the beasts treated with a stimulant to make them more enraged or bloodthirsty. It seemed that the Matador's mere existence was a personal insult to the Bull. It levelled its head and charged. The Matador whirled the cape over the beast, sidestepping and burying a darted blade into the beasts back. His sword he sheathed in the sand as he sidestepped. \"He's skilled.\" She allowed, not entirely sure what the Reverend Mother was leaning towards. She never said anything that was not a secret lesson. Apparently, it was clear to the Reverend Mother as well, who did look look happy at the response as her mouth twisted beneath the veil of her Aba hood. \"He is. But all Sardaukar are skilled. Glida, what do you see?\" Glida slithered forward silently and Demelza felt a rush of loathing to the girl. She had been born on Wallach IX and trained in the Chapterhouse from birth. She seemed to do everything perfectly and worse, she was beautiful. An elfine nose, heart shaped face and golden curls were difficult to conceal beneath the drab black hood as she smiled smugly. \"Sardaukar are skilled or suicidal, throwing themselves into combat until their enemies break or retreat. This one has some self preservation in him. Not drilled out by his training. See how he watches the bulls every move?\" When the bull came in for another charge, it swung its head...too fast. The energy of the half shield fluctuated as the Sardaukar angled it carefully. Demelza only wished that she hadn't needed to be humiliated for the lesson to be drilled into her. She sighed softly. The Reverend Mother nodded and turned her head to Demelza. \"We have an assignment for you.\" The sound dampener in the box would keep their voices from carrying. It was meant to keep the viewers from being deafened so they could speak to their guests or seatmates, but it made for a fine way to keep from being overheard. \"You'll be travelling to Chimera when the next Guild Heighliner arrives. You have important work to do there.\" Demelza felt puzzled. She was only a sister. Not important enough to know of the secret ranks and she had not even went through the Agony, the test that would allow her to become a Reverend Mother in her own right. She wracked her brain, thinking of the planet Chimera. Three moons, heavy rainfall and mostly ocean, with a few small islands barely made habitable by sea walls. ************************************* CHIMERA Sykorn was examining the bodies when Assad arrived. When new recruits came to Chimera, they were usually interrogated thoroughly and searched. However, one of them had been a spy with a poisoned tooth and, rather than be questioned, he had bitten and exhaled the poison, killing himself...and two other recruits who had been too close. It was customary for Sy to study the bodies, examining and ensuring that there were no more surprises. The three were spread on the tables. Usually, she had a few more in terms of medical staff in the large and pristine white chambers. However, she hated risking others and so had decided to do the examination herself. The light of glowglobes in the room illuminated the bodies and they were cast in a brighter light when she ran the overhead scanner over the sternums, checking them for incisions, scars or other dangerous irradiation. Assad was deathly silent, knowing better than to disturb her, especially when she drew the incision knife. It was only when she set it aside that he approached. \"Is there any other signs of weapons?\" He asked. Sy gently reached up and brushed her bangs from her forehead. The lights of the room, especially down in the lower levels, away from habitation, were hot, but Assad's dark skin seemed cool and calm. Of course, he had come from a world much hotter than this. His blue within blue eyes did not flick upwards towards the diamond tattoo that marked her as a student of the Suk school of medicine, though she was sure they would for a moment. \"There's no trace of explosives as of yet.\" She said. However, their enemies, whoever they were, were ingenious. She doubted that they would simply send a single man with a poisoned tooth without some kind of secondary threat implanted. \"Have you examined for chemical weaponry?\" He asked, moving closer to her. His jacket and pants were black and bore the Cuttlefish of the House upon the breast. She wore medical white. \"Not yet.\" She said, her eyes drawn to the crimson lips, the mark of sapho. \"Here.\" Assad said. \"It'll go faster if we work together.\" To steady himself, he reached to his belt and drew a flask, lifting it to his lips and swallowing. She caught the barest hint of cinnamon, the smell of spice beer. It was not unpleasant and he closed the bottle and sheathed it again before reaching to the scalpel as she did. His hand rested on hers a moment before he turned, grabbing an unoccupied blade and moved to one of the bodies. \"Do you believe the other recruits were possible plants as well?\" He asked. \"Better safe than sorry.\" Sy answered. Assad's Mentat calculations were fast and she had taught him what she could. She knew he retained it all and he was running through the safest ways of dissecting the body.",

        "comment": "In 1933, Carl Denham shocked the world when he unveiled King Kong to a stunned crowd at the Alhambra Theatre The twenty-five-foot tall ape delivered the scientific community a one-two punch that sent it reeling with the impact of this incredible discovery and subsequent tragic loss. But Kong was just the beginning. An entire island, bursting with prehistoric wonders, existed. If Kong had shocked the scientific world, Skull Islands emergence fro m the shroud of legend into reality shocked it to its core. Not since Columbus's discovery of the New World had mankind been offered such an opportunity to explore a land trapped in time. Kong's chest beating roar at the summit of the Empire State Building heralded the greatest discovery of the century-arguably the millennium. In the wake of the islands unveiling, universities and private organizations across the planet fumbled to dispatch teams to investigate and catalogue its wonders. The race of the century was on. Rival expeditions fought for exclusivity and justification, each asserting its own legal standing to be first on the island. Only a handful of the two dozen expeditions successfully made landfall and-of those-half were woefully unprepared for the terrors that awaited them. Skull Island ate expeditions with all the appetite of the full grown *V.Rexes*that ruled the landmass in Kong's absence. After a year of disastrous excursions and tragic loss of life, a properly prepared, jointly managed and financed effort was finally organized by the three biggest interested concerns. Lead by Carl Denham himself(just off several dozen lawsuits for damages and needing the money), this three month expedition set out to systemically explore and document the island. *Project Legacy*-as it was called, suffered its own set of mishaps and attrition, but it was a far cry from the earlier ill-founded attempts. The most important realization of this 1935 trip was that Skull Island was too new, too strange and, above all, too dangerous to study in such a short space of time.With countless discovery of new species and new behaviours every day, it became clear that decades of study *might*scrape the surface of what the island may have hidden from the world for so long. *Project Legacy*was expanded to a long-term study, with annual expeditions, the long term goal of which was to establish a permanent base of operations on the Island. It was during the second incursion in 1936 that the truth of Skull Island's geological fragility became clear. A huge earthquake sank one part of the island, killing five team members. After careful exploration by a team of geologists, the expedition realized that Skull Island was a doomed oddity, a scab on the earth's crust that would eventually be scratched off. All plans to make a permanent base on the island were halted and, in 1941, as the US finally joined the cause in World War 2, Skull Island and any plans towards discovery of all it had to offer was forgotten. *************************************** Elizabeth, Oliver: A group of five, scientists, doctors and the like stood around the table where the map lay. Captain Daniel Colton stood on the other side of the table, arms across his chest as he regarded them, dark eyes focused on them under the brim of his cap. \"Almost three months we've been travelling. Are you sure those coordinates are right?\" Everett Hunter, the head of the operation, nodded. \"Denham said its not the original, but he read the original so many times that it burned into his brain. He remembered.\" \"Why so jumpy?\" Weston Marks, a cryptozoologist, asked. \"My men are going to be helping you. Weapons, food, all being provided for. Are you going to be able to pay the rest of the money at the end?\" \"Afraid of losing your investment?\"Everett said, only half joking. Colton shrugged. \"If you're eaten in the jungle, it makes little difference to me. However, I am providing manpower to aid you and keep you alive. If THEY die as well, it'll be a real thorn in my side.\" *************************************** Amie: \"Miss Winthorpe? Miss WINTHORPE?!\" Amie raised her head from where she stood by the railing, wondering if she looked as green as she felt, wiping her mouth. Liam, one of the younger sailors, was looking at her with some concern. \"You don't look so good Miss Winthorpe.\" He said, pushing his cap back on his head. He had an accent that she recognized as Dublin by the lilt in it. \"I'm fine. The cooks food doesn't...oof....doesn't really sit right.\" She said, managing a little smile. Barely. But it was more than that. Months on this tramp steamer that should have been decommissioned a decade ago and sometimes the vestiges of seasickness rose up. And the food....while every fortnight she could get something that seemed halfway edible, the rest of the time they ate what they had. A week ago, she had some Cherry Blossom meat which, she realized too late, was raw horse. The most recent was tuna eyeballs in porridge. But things were tough all over and she shouldn't complain. This year, rationing had gone into effect for several foods and canned meat, butter and the like had been added to the list. Still, she had made sure everything she ate was at least warm enough to burn, hoping it would kill any pathogens. Not that it did her stomach any good. *This is your own fault.* She reproached herself for the fiftieth time that day. *One word. You only had to remember one damn word.* Nolan Strauss, the Editor-In-Chief of the *New York Times*had told her to get onto the ship, the *Atlas*. While she had her doubts when she had first boarded, she had figured he had a very good reason for sending her here. She had figured it was something connected to the army base article she was supposed to cover. Instead, she had discovered a few days into the journey where they were going. A straight shot West of Sumatra, far away from anything connected to the war or any interest pieces. The Captain, a handsome middle aged man named Colton, while sympathetic to her plight, assured her that accommodations would be provided to her and she had been given a cabin. However, heading back or diverting was out of the question, would put the Expedition to the Island back a few weeks, something that he couldn't allow. He promised that if they encountered another ship, he would allow her to get off his own and go with the other to its final destination. They had encountered no other ships. Of course not. What kind of ship used steam nowadays? Hadn't most ships switched to fuel? \"Here, come on.\" Liam said, leading her across the deck by the arm. Passing an old seaplane (which was set for emergency search and rescue)to just outside the galley, returning with some small crackers. \"Old trick. Just nibble some of these.\" The crackers tasted a little stale, but they tasted far better than the food she was used to. \"So, you've been here for a while. What do you think of the ship?\" Liam smiled. \"And what are you going to do when we get...there?\" He added. She didn't need to ask where \"there\"was. *************************************** Harold: Harold woke to the feeling of hard stone under his face and soaked clothes, the scent of seawater in his nostrils. Pushing his face from the stone, he felt himself looking into a screaming face. Had he been a child and not a veteran of a war, he would have jumped, startled. But he faced the silent face, the ancient carving of some civilization or another jutting out of the sea. Looking about, he saw what he had feared since he had awoken. His ship, smashed to kindling on the rocks. After the fog had rolled in and the storm had blown them off course, he had feared as much. But something niggled at him as he rose to his feet. Oscar. Where was he? Gauging by what he could see, it had been a while since he had been knocked out. Surely Oscar, if he had been dead, would have washed up too? Unless he had washed up elsewhere.This ancient spar of rocky cove was the only place that someone could safely climb ashore. There, ahead. He could see a pathway up the rocks, along a crumbled causeway. Skull Island awaited.",

The people who survived the coming days would often repeat that in reply to questions of where they were when it all began. Some people became aware as police would appear every other block, when people began to disappear and helicopters buzzed over the city. But there was no other news. There were no preparations set by the government until just before the world ended. And by then, it was too late. **THE DEAD WALK!** *EVA* Eva paced the church aisle, pressing the phone to her ear as she anxiously fiddled with the lace of her dress. Her, once, pristine hair now had strands flying out from the pins and her makeup was beginning to wear off. He was meant to be here an hour ago, what do you mean you cant find him? Where did he go? A mumbling voice is heard on the other end from family members spread around her. The mother of the groom is sobbing as she is comforted by the father of the groom and the brides parents. I dont understand! Where could he have gone?! He wouldnt do this to me! I look like a fucking idiot! She turned to apologize to the reverend for her language, who looked at her reproachfully, but with pity. Just find him! She hung up and slammed the phone down on a nearby table. I cant believe he would do this to me! She stormed down the aisle and out of the church doors to shocked looks as the angry bride ran down the steps and took off down the street. *CHAD* Chad had been eyeing a young black woman up and down the moment he laid eyes on her in the dorm room hallway. There weren't many other girls he WOULDN'T have slept with, though that weird girl that kept herself locked up in her dorm might have been a looker if she would actually come out. He fixed his wheat brown cap putting it over to the side. His friends would know that usually meant he was ready to work his magic. The lady in question was Taylor Johnson. She had light brown skin and a contagious smile. Chad thought about making a move on her. He knew she was dating a football player much more built and better looking then him; still, no girl hes given it his all has rejected him. Suddenly someone slapped his cap off and turning around irritated he had seen his friend Ben. Unlike most of his friends, Ben has stuck with him through thick and thin. Wheres that twenty bucks you owe me? A flustered Chad dragged Ben into his dorm. Dude I was about to make my move with Taylor! Why the fuck are you coming at me with this shit now!? Ben smirked but Chad wasnt amused. Regardless this has been two weeks and you said youd pay me back. Chad nodded in agreement. Fine but Im going to need to borrow your car. Ben handed him the key. Upon entering Bens car, the seat belt light indicator lit up. Fuck that. As he put it in drive, he noticed the constant annoyance of the seat belt alert sound. Chad pulled to the side of the road being irritated, he ripped out the seat belt and threw it into the back seat of the sedan. There, happy now? A few minutes later, he is seen parked in a no parking zone. Ben had always kept his car with a full tank of gas and kept the inside in pristine condition. Chad did love his adventures. He had driven all across town throwing all his food, trash, and all his other crap all over the interior. The gas tank was a hair away from empty. For some reason, he was always good in locating money. Looking through the center console, he found a twenty dollar bill. Chad felt the need to return the money but couldnt help to see his favorite strip club nearby. Several more minutes later, he walked out with a huge smile across his face. He knew he shouldnt have used Bens money but it was worth making it rain on the strippers at the strip club. He walked across the street laughing as he had only $0.17 to his name at the ATM machine. Turning around to his horror, Bens car had been towed leaving him without a vehicle and nearly stranded alone. Fuuuuuuuck. Shortly after his small outburst is when the ear ringing siren starts blaring off. Chad wondered what that was for only a second, now he only wished it would stop making that noise. He is seen walking up the sidewalk back towards his college with the intent of telling Ben the bad news. He had spent his money, put no gas in his vehicle, trashed it, and his car is in impound somewhere. He could make it right but that would take too much time out of his day. Chad knew if he talked with Ben at a nice steakhouse, he could get him to understand. He could taste that medium steak hitting his lips already and he was a quick eater too, so quick hell finish and leave for the other person to foot the bill. *VANESSA* It was a regular afternoon, Vanessa was in her kitchen, preparing supper for herself. Next to the cutting board she was using was her cellphone, her mother on the other end, the speaker on. The phone connection had been bad for the last few hours, which made her mothers voice sometimes go quiet and sometimes cut out completely. But it was holding steady for the time being. So, howre things with the baby? Sandras voice resonates through the speakerphone.Are you taking your medicine? Vanessa was using her voice to distract her while she chopped up veggies, the recently sharpened blade slicing through them easily.Yes Ma, I just got a new batch from the doctor yesterday. She didn't mention how her usual doctor was out sick. As long as she got the meds, she was happy. Mrs. Phan hummed a noise, then continued And I assume youre making other preparations for the baby? Questioned her mother, the curiosity clear in her voice.Im assuming youve bought a crib by now? Brown eyes turn to the phone for a moment, her knife half cut through a chunk of carrot.You know, I was actually thinking of co-sleeping. Like, have the baby in the bed with me Vanessa noted Read somewhere it helps with the bonding process. The other end was fuzzy in terms of audio, but she could hear her mother make a unnapproving noise Nes, sweetie, that might not be for the best Sandra scolds What if you roll on the baby? Vanessa choked on a snicker, but bit it down to not upset her mother. As ridiculous as that sounded, she knew her mother was merely worried. Relax, Im not gonna roll on the baby She says, barely hiding some amusement. Sandra seemed to reluctantly give out an I know It was almost sing song in response. Sandra paused, then sighed I justIf Marcus had to come home, and find something happened while he was away Vanessas smile dropped for a second, hand moving to her belly thoughtfully. She could vaguely feel the infant stir within from under her palm. I know, IEverything will be fine, hell be back soon and everything will be fine She said, voice soft. Her mother wanted to believe what she was saying, but she still felt stressed. Her hand tightening on the handle of her kitchen knife. She changed subject quickly Look, I gotta go, Im starving and I need to finish dinner. Sandra seemed to finally relent Alright hun, I love you. Love you too, mom.\" Then she hung up the phone with a tap of her finger. Outside the window, she saw a pair of police cars speed by the building below, their sirens blaring, and the louder alarm of a fire truck a few blocks away. This was a nice neighbourhood and she and Marcus had moved in together shortly after marrying. Her father had helped some out of concern for her well being, though he sometimes seemed stingy to the point that handing over the money had been like pulling teeth. He was far from happy from the match, though it was more for the danger of the job Marcus had taken rather than any dislike of the man himself. He was happy Nes was happy, but he would have disliked Marcus if he had been a cop or a firefighter too. He wanted his daughters life to be secure and for her to be provided for. Especially now that she was going to be a mother. Things had been extremely loud in the neighbourhood for the last few days. But she was excited, because Marcus was supposed to be webcamming with her this evening.",

The air in her room felt thick and heavy, as her bedroom faced the sun as it crossed the sky. She had been considering moving to another room to see if opening a window there would make her even a percentage cooler when an owl flew in through the window, dropping a letter on her bed before flapping off. Skye was not unknowledgeable of her true nature, which has been kept a secret from their neighbours before and after they moved. She had spent a whole year at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry before her mother took her from her home, her school and her friends to settle down with some man she barely knew in Epsom. However, she had not expected this. She thought her life at wizarding schools were done. However, it wasn't over yet. She made her way into the downstairs. Her mother and her fiancee(Skye still refused to call him \"dad\"or \"stepdad\")were having tea. Despite the heat, Octavius insisted on it. \"I...I just got this.\" Skye said, feeling nervous and excited all at once as she laid it on the table. Skye's mother gave a squeak and her fiancee, Octavius Prewett, rose, a broad smile on his handsome face. \"Amazing. Astounding! Amazing! Open it!\" She read it out. Some things on the list, she still had. Her wand, for one.However, given that she was underage, she had been forbidden to use it after she was removed from Ilvermorny. Her cauldron was gone, having been burned up in one of her attempts to experiment with potions(given it wasn't really magic, there was no reason that she couldn't try, right?)and her robes were made for Ilvermorny, not Hogwarts. She heard the money here was different too. \"I'm so proud of you Skye!\" Her mother said, hugging her tight. Octavius gently, but awkwardly, patted her shoulder just below where her mother's arms locked her in a fierce embrace. \"Right. We'll need to get the supplies in London. Diagon Alley. The Floo Network would be the fastesf way. I'm sure that we can find them all. We could both take you there later this week!\" He said, grinning again, putting his arm around Skye's mother(who had finally released her)who gave a watery smile to her daughter. ************************************* KAYLEIGH When they had settled in Brighton, Kayleigh's parents had done so to be...removed from things. However, as it was summer and Brighton was a resort town, this made the summers especially difficult in terms of traffic as they tried to wend their way back. The cars were fender to fender and did not seem to be moving any time soon. Stella Diggory was slender, with dark hair to her shoulders. Aiden Diggory was plump around the middle and had no hair. All in all, they balanced each other well. Usually good natured, Kayleigh's father was swelling up as he sat in the front seat. Muggle traffic got him closer to exploding. Usually, he was the disciplinarian of the family, not that Kayleigh truly needed it. However, these Muggles...he had once nearly drawn his wand on someone who had gestured rudely to him through the window. This would be bad enough, but her father had never truly gotten the hang of Muggle clothing, having donned a violet purple waistcoat, bright yellow trousers, a deerstalker hat and violent orange suspenders. Her mother had long learned how to dress properly and she seemed a proper Muggle, working even to the last minute. More than once, Kayleigh had found her slumped over the Muggle paperwork and snoring with it plastered to her cheek by drool. She was fumbling through her papers in the front seat, shuffling through them carefully, searching for a single line that she had misplaced. The two, so caught up in their own annoyances, were too busy to notice Kayleigh's visitor as it knocked on the window with its beak, hovering as best as its tiny wings would allow. \"If some Muggle cyclist knocking on the window...\" Aiden growled. Kayleigh rolled down the window and caught the tiny owl, who was holding a letter twice as large as it in her hands. The owl gratefully perched still atop her hand as she took the letter off its leg, then flopped onto its back with a hoot, exhausted. The letter...it was the one she had been expecting for years. *Hogwarts.* ************************************* ASHER Asher and his foster parents had only just got off the plane. Adam and Margaret had done the best they could to keep up with the news after the letter had come, clutched in the beak of a very wet and bedraggled looking owl, which had rested a full week in their one story home before flying off again. The owl had carried a waterproof pouch with it bearing a letter enscribed with four animals around an H, as well as a small letter enclosed. However, enclosed in the letter had been a smaller letter written in angular letters very different than the enclosed list of books and acceptance letters, the envelope having been folded extremely small. This, Asher had read with some excitement. *I was a friend of your parents. They went to school at Hogwarts and I believe that for all involved, your return to this historic school and understanding of your family and your own abilities would be best for all involved. While other magical schools like Ilvermorny exist in the States, I believe that your path would be best served here.* *RIV* An enclosed letter for his foster parents gave instructions on where to take him. They were going to a hidden alley of sorts to get what they needed. \"Are we sure about this?\" Margaret asked, mousey and nervous. It had taken all she had not to blab to everyone in the neighbourhood when Asher's letter had come. \"Fine time to be asking now....\" Adam said gloomily as he gathered the suitcases from the baggage area. \"We already got the plane tickets and everything.\" \"We're sure this isn't a prank or anything?\" She asked, looking at Asher. \"I mean, really...\" \"We're here now. We'll get a hotel and then go and get the things we need. Though maybe we won't discuss them out here now.\" Adam said, clearing his throat. Outside the terminal, he set down his suitcase and waited for the next taxi. Turning to Asher, he clapped a hand on his shoulder. \"Alright, son?\" ************************************* *AARON* It had been a long drive, but his uncle and he had finally made it into London. The discussion had been over getting supplies for a new boarding school. Aaron and his uncle had pondered and argued over which school would be best. Smeltings had been one, but Aaron could not consider himself being dressed in those outfits, even to show to his parents, even if it was for pretend. His uncle had even jokingly considered \"St.Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys\", but Aaron had finally convinced him to give up on it, as his parents would never believe it, given his record as a student. He had been confused and questioning the letter since it had come, an envelope bearing four animals and had opened it to read that he was a wizard. True, there had been strange occurences around him...but he had never believed HE had caused them. So, as they parked outside the pub \"the Leaky Cauldron\", he wondered if this was all just a joke or a hoax, had hidden the letter when it had arrived, but his uncles involvement had convinced him to give it a go. \"Right. Inside then Aaron.\" Uncle Ted said, giving a gesture with his hand. His uncle had lived with them since Aaron had been about five years old. His father sometimes sniped at him for being lazy, but Ted was far more understanding in some ways than his father could be. Inside the pub, a young woman stood behind the bar and a few strangely dressed people were sitting about.",
