Times before they had been repelled, but this time they were organised and determined.  They seized the mountain, and forced most of the elves out.\nThey thought they could control the Jinta.\n\nThey could stifle it - but they could not fully control it.\n\nThe Sanate elves turned to stone as the Garginoids corrupted its power.\nThe M\u0101kai elves, however, were able to escape and make homes elsewhere.\n\nAll over the land, crop yields were high, and deaths from disease increased.  The sky just seemed a little greyer.\n\nThe Garginoids also suffered.  They became unable to reproduce, and struggled to obtain enough food.  Of course, they terrorised nearby villages for resources.\n\nThe average life span of a Garginoid is fifty years.  So, now, twenty years later, it is reckoned safe to return.  The elves have built themselves up and acquired some new friends.  The Garginoids they calculate are now of reduced numbers, and advanced age\u2026\n\nHowever, the journey will not be easy.  Where once there was harmony and justice, now there is suspicion and fear.  Hard, even wicked rulers have replaced benign ones; and cruel creatures have moved into the region...\n",

They were in the heart of elven territory, in a clearing, surrounded by trees, once bright and lush, now dull and languid. ## They knew why they were there - more or less. A mission of great daring and danger. A chance to free the land of evil, and restore the Jinta to the elves. For some, the desire to bring freedom - to see justice done - was motivation enough.

From a distance, because of the way the Basilisk University perched near the top of a hill, it appeared to be on its own in the middle of nowhere. But it was not so. A short walk down the hill took you to the bustling town of Cindring, nestling in the valley. It was not a big town, but it was vibrant. And it was not unknown to the King. --- Basilisk University of Cindring was revered by many. To enter through its gates was to be assured a career amongst the magical classes. It prided itself on failing none. Of course, in its history some had been expelled, but that really was a situation of last resort. One either *Graduated*, or *Finished*. To *Finish* from Basilisk University was to be declared ready to serve on the staff of one of the great wizards or military. Even one who could not themselves learn to master magic could still make themselves useful in some profession and capacity. However, to ***Graduate*** from Basilisk University, to be declared a *Doyen of Dragons*, or a *Baccalaureate of Basilisk* -that was honour indeed. A **Doyen** would leave with their own dragon, and would be able to serve their King as an autonomous master of magic use, and dragon husbandry. A **Baccalaureate of Basilisk** would be qualified to join the Guild of Magicians, and serve in a dragon squadron - although they would not leave with a dragon of their own. The students came from all walks of life all had passed the exacting entrance interview. All were believed to have the right potential. --- Each of the students had to encounter Mallaidh Macbridei. She was a formidable woman. Many grew to respect her, but all feared her. She ensured good order was kept around the University. She would give each student their key, and show them on a plan where they would find their room. Exactly what her job title was, no-one quite knew. She was an institution in and of herself. She patrolled the corridors, and one did as she said. But one might also turn to her in a time of trouble. She greeted each with warmth, but had a firm warning for those who would venture into the town below the University. And there was the rub - she had cultivated a way of speaking which was hard to follow; \"The townsfolk are able and honest, but do not appreciate chaotic behaviour. This is our amplitude, and that is ancient. Bethink this at all times. You are apery Basilisk University aback you go there, and allegation do abolishment to accompany abashing on us.

Those who listen to the skies regularly get to know the sound of the crows. Short regular bursts is good news. They have seen nothing out of the ordinary. But irregular calls are a warning. Something is out of place. All round the valley, from mountains to forests to meadows, those who were awake at this hour and knew these calls looked across at its source. The River Trill. More specifically, the Cedar Bridge. One of the bridges that allowed Birdfolk to travel from Krannik to smaller settlements such as Kaliw and Groon. Normally, the water would twinkle under the bridge. Not this morning. Something was blocking the light. It was not hard to guess what - and for sure, there were plenty who would be quick to speculate. Trolls had taken up residence under the bridge. Probably Ruggorshar and Pimicle. They were always up to cause trouble, with their mud-minded hangers on. This was *disruptive*. Disruptive, and needless - the wolves were growing in number, and the trolls could have focused their energies on eating them and so keeping everyone happy. It was disruptive to the *Birdfolk*. They would be reluctant to use the bridge, so trade and communications would be inconvenienced and delayed. This would lead to more calls for trolls to be pushed further back to the other side of the mountains, which would annoy the trolls and cause tension and tit-for-tat \"incidents.\" It was disruptive to the *Golems*. In truth, it was probably to spite the Golems that the bridge had been occupied. If the Golems did nothing, the Trolls would take more and more liberties until they achieved a reaction. You could see how it might play out. In the end a Birdperson might go missing. Trolls would be blamed. Golems would be condemned for failing to act sooner. And of course - they, the Golems, were constructed to stand against \"the darkness\". What is the point of them, the cry would be, if they do nothing? Yet, let the Golems act, and just see what happens. As soon as Golems were to protest, or move in, or do *anything* in fact, the Troll chiefs would make noise. Complain of unfounded allegations, telling lies, jumping to conclusions. Back and forth the arguments would go, until arguments become incidents, incidents become stand-offs. And stand-offs become war. And it was *disruptive* to the *Trolls*. Ruggorshar was as manipulative as Pimicle was vicious. If the Troll chiefs let any perceived slight pass without making a rumpus, Ruggorshar will whip up discontent. The Chiefs have become soft, he would say; they are giving ground to the Golems, they have signed a pact with the Birdfolk, they have abandoned their people. Stirring the pot, weakening unity in the hope of gaining from despair. So, the Troll Chiefs have to defend the indefensible, whilst trying to smooth things over - as any escalation will just give Ruggorshar another chance to magnify their perceived failures, and move closer to the day when he topples them from their leadership.",

This divide is symbolised by distinct zones within the city, each with its own rules and challenges. **1. The Upper Echelons - The Privileged Elite** - *Location:* High above the city, the wealthy elite reside in luxurious penthouses and high-tech residences, basking in the comfort of their cyber-enhanced lifestyles. - *Lifestyle:* The Upper Echelons enjoy unparalleled access to advanced technology, impeccable security, and extravagant entertainment. Weapons are considered a status symbol and are prominently displayed as decor. - *Use of Weapons:* Weapons are primarily ornamental, reserved for displays of power and prestige. Discharging a weapon here is a grave offence, usually leading to severe consequences. **2. The Middle Ground - The Struggling Enhanced (Mods)** - *Location:* Between the opulence of the elite and the desperation of the slums lies the Middle Ground, where Mods with aspirations dwell. - *Lifestyle:* These Mods work tirelessly to pay for their enhancements, hoping to ascend to the Upper Echelons. Their lives are characterised by constant competition and ambition. - *Use of Weapons:* While weapons can be carried, they are expected to be used only in self-defence. Mods are caught in a perpetual struggle for status and advancement. **3. The Conurbation - A Blend of Rich and Poor** - *Location:* This area sits at the heart of the city, representing a transitional zone between wealth and poverty. - *Lifestyle:* Here, a mix of the rich and poor coexist. While some enjoy relative comfort, others struggle to make ends meet. The Conurbation hosts bustling markets, entertainment venues, and a diverse population. - *Use of Weapons:* Carrying weapons is common, but discharging them should be limited to acts of self-defence. The Conurbation serves as a melting pot of culture and commerce. **4. The Outer Fringes - Facing Poverty and Lawlessness** - *Location:* Moving away from the city centre, the Outer Fringes witness a rise in poverty and a decline in order. - *Lifestyle:* Residents here face economic hardships, limited access to technology, and basic amenities. Survival is a daily struggle. - *Use of Weapons:* In the Outer Fringes, weapons are readily used for both protection and aggression. Law enforcement is scarce, and vigilante justice is common. **5. The Wastelands - A Desolate, Lawless Abyss** - *Location:* Beyond the city's boundaries lies the desolate Wastelands, a harsh and lawless territory. - *Lifestyle:* The Wastelands are characterised by extreme pollution, an absence of law, and a return to a primitive existence. Those who venture here do so at their own peril. - *Use of Weapons:* In the Wastelands, weapons are a way of life, essential for survival in a hostile environment. Conflict and chaos reign supreme. The Urban Divide of Neo Elysia paints a vivid portrait of societal inequality, where the haves and have-nots are separated by both physical and metaphorical barriers.

        "comment": "####Click to see image in full --- **It is 3038.** The Earth Empire has crumbled as a cohesive political force. In its wake came a certain freedom. But also uncertainty. Earths contribution to the Galactic community was not as fantastic as they sometimes allowed themselves to believe. Human sneakiness sometimes gave them an edge over the wisdom or inventiveness of other species, and allowed them to circumnavigate the will of brute aggression. But of course that by no means meant that everything they did with their influence was uncompromisingly beneficial. Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell. One thing Earth did do well, however, was conferences. Their great gift to the cosmos. Wonderful melting pots of social etiquette, good coffee, and strangely flavoured vol-au-vents. Nathan Smoltzs Conference Badge making company - Intergalactic Badge Services - had ridden high on the buoyant intergalactic conference business - and came crashing down when Earths Empire became a spent force. No one was happier than Nathan when the Galactic Federation started to cumulate, bringing with it as it did a series of meetings, congresses, and conferences. A new golden age of badge making was being ushered in. Still, he was a bit jittery. This was a big conference, and a big event. The Alpha Centaurians were nice enough but a bit...well, creepy. They were various hues of green, quite tall, and notable by the single, large eye that dominated their bulbous heads, also marked by thick blood vessels. They looked, he thought, a bit like vertical caterpillars, with several tentacle-like arms terminating in claws. They were very keen that everything went smoothly. At the last minute, as Nathan saw it, he was asked not only to prepare the badges, but also ensure only the right people came in, give directions, and keep everyone moving. The Alpha Centaurians were very proud of their cultural heritage. The whole event was to be hosted in what seemed like a great art gallery, with winding corridors displaying great works of art, little ante-rooms housing portfolios of poetry, and three listening rooms where music would be performed to help delegates unwind. In Nathans opinion, they would *need* to unwind, after getting half-lost wandering around it all. It was arranged over 5 floors (of great architecture, let it be noted) with the reception and food court at the entrance level, the main conference hall on the first floor, the suites of delegates on the second floor, some break-out meeting rooms on the third floor, two theatres and two listening rooms on the fourth floor, and on the fifth floor was the grandest of the listening rooms and some more suites for guests. Everywhere was a maze of corridors to maximise the opportunities to display art, with alcoves boasting sculptures. Grand stairways went up from either side of the reception, with lifts strategically arranged around the place to provide more opportunities for artistic displays. *The Xlanthius delegation is already here -as are the Ice Warriors. The Malcassairos have only just confirmed so they are not on the official list but should be welcomed* purred Hecto Shellac, the Alpha Centarian giving Nathan most of his orders. Their voice was feminine to Nathan's ears, but that was just his human perspective. *\"Treat the observer from Peladon patiently,\"* they continued, *\"we are hoping they will join us formally...steer the Draconians and Thoros-Beta Mentors to the top floor please... ah, look, I will write it down for you, so you know who goes where.*",

        "comment": "##Base camp, New Eden The group made their way through a range of terrain. Jungle, woods, bush, and what the map called farmland, which did indeed look fertile and ready for use, and indeed which had various cultivated plants already growing on it. There were snags - thickets to cut through, rivers to work around - even a wasp nest to avoid! However, they made it, at last, to *base camp*. Felix was delighted with everything about base camp. It was of course very basic - almost an anti-climax from the beauty of what they had seen en route. Flat, even coarse grass with a few tiny shelters. Sierra noted the grass was the sort which would be hard wearing and not grow too long - like an outdoor carpet. But it meant it was a blank canvas. They could do what they wanted here. There was enough shelter for everyone to have sufficient privacy in the short term, and in the longer term they could build better homes. Perhaps cabins - maybe even tree houses! In all directions there was greenery of different hues - forest, jungle, scrubland. Mountains ranged where they had not explored yet. Felix spoke to others excitedly about the great waterfall and lake which the website said was nearby. There was still so much to find, he told the others. The farm would need a lot of work - but there was already growing yam, arrowroot, potatoes, plus some berries and bananas. June also found a lime tree! There would be enough food for some decent carbs, and there were also some bushes of fragrant herbs which would change the taste. According to the blog, many food plants were available nearby - it was a question of foraging in the short term, and cultivating and taking cuttings longer term. Felix also found a little cache of tools. A couple of saws wrapped in an oiled cloth. But also there were some more rudimentary wood cutting tools, made from bits of stone - like flint tools, though he was not sure it was technically flint. Some had been bound into wooden handles. Guys, I think I can see what we need to do here. You see these modern tools? They will help break the back of big cutting jobs. But we should use them sparingly, and maintain them well, so they do not break or become useless. Once a job is started, and it is possible to use these more basic tools, we should use them instead, as they can be replaced. We do the tough work with the best, and then it will be easy to finish with the primitive! Its a bit like me and my glasses. I am keeping my real ones for best - whenever I do anything that may risk them, I will try to use my replacements. --- They were happy. There was so much to be hopeful about, and all the signs were that this would really work. However, they had their doubts. Of course they did. Some thought about those they had left behind; or worried if everyone would work properly together and do what was best for themselves - and each other. Maybe they could help steer the society towards having some sort of order. As they rested, they reflected on their journey. The flights from various places to get to the port: then the journey by ship - and at last the covert escape by boat. Amazingly, they had actually done it! They realised that now the time was to get to know one another properly, and plan for the future. Maybe first, they needed to truly understand themselves.",

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the streets, there were many who were wishing for a better life. Some yearned for wealth and prosperity, while others craved love and companionship. But alas, not all wishes come true.* *In a dimly lit corner of the city, there sat a man named Edward. He was a simple man, with simple desires. All he wanted was a warm meal and a place to lay his head at night. But despite his best efforts, he had never been able to make ends meet. As he trudged through the streets, his stomach growling with hunger, he couldn't help but feel like the world was against him.* *And then there was Mary.

But despite her many attempts at love, she had been met with disappointment and heartbreak at every turn. She was beginning to lose hope that she would ever find true love.* *As the night wore on, Edward and Mary found themselves walking along the same path. They didn't know each other, but there was a sense of camaraderie between them. They were both people who had been let down by life, and they found solace in each other's company.* *And then something strange happened. As they walked, they stumbled upon a mysterious figure who offered them each a wish. Edward wished for a warm meal and a place to stay, while Mary wished for a true love that would never leave her side.* *But as the night wore on, they both realized that their wishes had been in vain. Edward's warm meal turned out to be cold, and his place to stay was infested with rats. And Mary's true love turned out to be nothing more than a passing fancy.* *As they sat together, cold and hungry and alone, they realized that sometimes the things we wish for are not the things we truly need.* *It was a story that repeated many times, throughout human history.* *But, sometimes, fools had trusted in magical beings to fulfil their wishes. Seldom did this end well.* *Most, if they lived to regret their decision at all, saw themselves as fighting a power that would always be greater than them.* But one man refused to accept this fate... ---- #Burned by the things you wish for? ---- So read the eye-catching headline of a blog that circulated throughout the vast expanse of the internet.

Of the few, only a couple dared to arrive at the appointed hour. \"Candent\" was not disappointed by the no-shows, but more delighted that he had found a pair who truly had the courage to follow through.

Times before they had been repelled, but this time they were organised and determined.  They seized the mountain, and forced most of the elves out.\nThey thought they could control the Jinta.\n\nThey could stifle it - but they could not fully control it.\n\nThe Sanate elves turned to stone as the Garginoids corrupted its power.\n\nThe M\u0101kai elves, however, were able to escape and make homes elsewhere.\n\nAll over the land, crop yields were high, and deaths from disease increased.

        "comment": "Our tale begins in a homely, comfortable tavern, with a fire flickering in the grate. This is very good fortune. Had you joined us several days ago, you would have seen a dwarf, an elf and a halfling in a most unhappy state - trapped beneath their own upturned waggon, sealed in by the silk of a giant spider, and about to be consumed by her hatchlings. On that occasion, however, all had not been lost, as it might have first appeared. By good fortune, a party of halflings and goblins happened along, and saved our friends from a most unpleasant fate. It may surprise you to learn that halflings and goblins were associated together. But these were fallen times. Elf Mountain was in the hands of the Garginoids - thuggish, unpleasant creatures. As a result, the Jinta crystal - the true power behind the mountain, and indeed the land - was stifled, unable to radiate its goodness. This led to failure of crops, hardening of hearts, and cooling of friendships. From a time of plenty and harmony, the land descended into want and suffering. And so it happened that halflings had to up and leave their homes, and in their hunger and desperation even goblins would work with such, if it meant they could defend a trading operation so as to eek out a living. It came to pass therefore that an unlikley grouping of creatures stood by the side of the road leading past Gemchester. Periwick - the halfling lead negotiator in a trading partnership with Haldon Blacktoes and a number of other halflings and goblins, forced into an alliance of convenience by their need to survive. Zolon - a rather disheveled looking Halfling, but secretly a Scout in a mission to retake Elf Mountain. Yotmuck the dwarf - a most ignoble example of his race, worrying currently about the contents of his spoiled waggon Zentha, a most unorganised example of an elven scout. Zolon knew he was at rock bottom. He had been hurt, and needed treatment. He knew that even yet, he may not survive. With nothing less to lose, he was open about his plans. The others there saw it was not a good plan. But it was a plan where few others exisited; and would represent at least an attempt to deal with an evil could not be left unchecked any longer. It was now, or never. They were a most unlikely, rag tag bunch. And yet, it dawned upon them, that amongst this assembly was likely to be the core of an attack on Elf Mountain. An attempt to take it back. There was little chance of success. But failure was not an option, and there was unlikely to be a Plan B any time soon. Periwick had looked at the others and said, This is no place to talk. Up this road towards Lime Pass - keep walking about five hours and you will happen upon a tavern. Its called The Good Frog - a strange name in these times but it is safe. Take a room there. Give me a day. I will be there in due course, with as many as I can muster, and a means of transport. We will complete the journey. Together. Yotmuck stepped forward. He will not walk. I have not salvaged much from my waggon, but what I have I will trade to fund a carridge or ponies. I will travel with him to the tavern. We will wait for you. I trust you will come good, Periwick. Yotmuck had helped Zolon to The Good Frog. Periwick had made discrete enquiries of others in Gemchester, to see who might be persuaded to join them. And, as I started by saying, we find one another in a good tavern, as new allies assemble. Zolon had slept there for several days, as strong medicine helped him heal. When at last he was fully back on his feet, he headed down to the dining area where there was food, and, perhaps more importantly, the assembled group who had elected to join him on his quest.",

The home of the Emperor, a centre of commerce and diplomacy, a cultural hub - not to mention the focal point of many a trade route. But today was special. A *huge* royal banquet was happening tonight. There were many visitors - the great and the good from this kingdom and many others besides. For all his power and influence, it was an important evening for the Emperor. A chance for him to show how great and strong and wise he was. Anything that might challenge the pecking order...that might suggest his grip was failing...this could not be left to chance. Peace and prosperity was dependent upon the Emperor commanding the respect and confidence of all. But there was another buzz starting to grow in the city. People whispering, one to another. Shock. Giggles. Shaking heads from those who could not, would not believe the stories that were circulating.... --- ###Jennifer Trimm, the Mistress of the Robes, was starting to hear some of those strange stories - just fragments, but she was determined to get to the bottom of them. At first, because she was simply intrigued. But then, because she stared to get the uneasy feeling it might affect her... For her afternoon break, she had wandered into one of the fancy tea-rooms just near the Palace. A good place to socialise with the very best in society - and enjoy some excellent cake, and of course the finest tea the town had to offer. In whispered conversations, there was cheeky talk ... talk that seemed to involve the Emperor. Seemed to involve his clothes. As Mistress of the Robes, that was very close to home ... and she had sold off a bundle of his clothes this very lunchtime ... She had understood that he had purchased some new garments from those merchants who had been to see him. She had tried to block it, herself, she did not trust him; but you do not argue with the Emperor. Now what was all this idle talk about his clothes.... and she was in it deep for having sold some of them? --- ###Lukas Pal, Royal Messenger. He was fast. That was his job. But today, he was faster than ever - propelled in no small part by the mighty gust of the (naked, as it happened - but rude to notice) Emperor's yells. And, indeed, the royal foot. ***\"My clothes! They have gone to the incinerator! Catch them before they are burned!\"*** He hesitated, understandably confused. ***Messenger, go get my clothes back. Or die.*** So he scrambled down the corridor, down the stairs, past the butler, pretty much through the footman (and was now wearing some Royal roast dinner)...to the incinerator. Frantically, he had started pulling things from the flames, and great cost to his fringe and eyebrows, before the incinerator sweeper had managed to get out of him what the problem was. ---- ###Anna O'Donnell, incinerator sweeper \"Oh no, those clothes were not burned. They were taken to the housekeeper's assistant, to turn into blankets for the local poor. Come, I will show you.\" Anna was duly propelled along by the frantic messenger, passing through a great barrow of leaves and various other refuse that was being wheeled in. --- ###Kyle Ackleson, Housekeeper's assistant. Kyle was surprised to see the messenger and Anna bursting in. And perturbed that Anna was after the clothes back. He had thought it was settled that they were surplus to requirements. Good news - they had not been cut up. Bad news - they were not here, either. --- ###Walter Lackey, Merchant. Meanwhile, a merchant stood near the city gates, by the coach-house. His plan had been to travel out of town, to find the best possible price for his...latest acquisition. But now, that did not seem such a great idea. First of all, there were so many wealthy merchants - and, indeed, fine people from far and wide - pouring through the city gates, he was sure he could make a good profit right here. Besides that, it was difficult to conceal the sheer opulence of the clothes he had bundled up. That was getting him some rather...unwanted attention. He had not really thought the security issue through. Maybe a quick sale would be wise - before they were taken from him by some gang of ruffians...",

You see small boats come in on one side - they will be on the other side, too, and it looks like there are some round at the south. There is a long walkway in the middle, with lots going off, actually, **up**.* *As I say, it is not a map, and can only begin to give you a picture of what it is like to be in Frostvale. Take that, and overlay it with a written description....* --- --- Long ago, Frostvale was a castle. Defending who from what is not clear, but they built it well. Four tall towers gave a good view and made an impression on they eye. Those towers, and most of the walls, were still there. So it is, that Frostvale could be seen more as one huge building than a town, though a town it surely is. The great walls and what would have been battlements now held shops on many levels, as did the towers. The centre was open, allowing daylight to come into the central part, but every available space had been utilised in some way. For as long as can be remembered, its location was important because it offered a resting point on a long waterway (part river, part canal) that linked two very important river networks which were vital to transport and trade. A series of locks allowed boats to move freely in either direction. The waterway was wide and deep. You would have been hard pressed to get a full ship along it (though it had been known, apparently!) but certainly some pretty big boats. Most however were barge-type vessels loaded with goods; and a few fishers. Routes south were not great, but used by some for continuing or joining journeys. North, there were the mountains. Huge, and virtually uncrossable. Nothing much of value was known to be there, though who knows. There are some dangers in the form of creatures, deep in the mountains, but it was the terrain and climate that posed the greatest risk. Besides, there was nothing worth crossing them for. Probably another Kingdom, if you went far enough - though it would be easier by far to go by land and sea another way. A nation of Kobolds was most likely that way - but much too far to be worth thinking about. Roundabout, there were a few little hamlets and settlements eking out a living. Some might supply eggs and other crops to the town. Just near the town, to either side, are the remains of trading centres that sprang up during the period of Frostvale's ... absence. They were redundant now, though some continued to live there, and carry on some sort of trade. But, those things apart, there was very little sign of other life for a long way in any direction. There were mountains, forests, planes, and the waterway, with the dramatic Falls. (There was also a strange building jutting out of the cliff, which was once a church, and was now a prison). I talked about the *absence* of Frostvale. Some few years back, the place disappeared. Totally - leaving just a strange, mighty, black crater where it once stood. It had been taken, wholesale, into another dimension. And through no small effort by a heroic few, in due course, returned. You might think there would be some physical evidence of its movement. Actually, there was very little. Frostvale did not go anywhere, physically. It did not bump or scrape. While it was gone, some moss, stone, mud and water egressed into the space it once held in this dimension, and when it returned, that was pushed out, with some residual marking. When it was first taken, a strange black fire appeared to consume it, though this was not so much burning it up as taking it away. If you knew where to look, you might see little cracks or marks or darkening here or there, but then again, it could just be your imagination... So let us talk about Frostvale... ---",

Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. ## Many of the bold heroes involved in the Battle of Yavin now have bounty on their heads. Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a gathering of freedom fighters led by General Rieekan has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. # The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space... --- --- Across the icy expanse of the windswept ice slope of the Plain of Hoth, a small figure could be seen galloping on a large grey snow lizard, a Tauntaun. The creature's two-legged gait kicked up curving plumes of snow as it sped forward. As the rider approached a slope, he pulled back on the reins, bringing the Tauntaun to a halt. Luke Skywalker, bundled up against the cold, removed his protective goggles and noticed something in the sky. He retrieved a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt, examining the smoke rising from the crash site of what was in reality an Imperial probe robot. With the wind whipping at his fur-lined cap, Luke activated a comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifted restlessly beneath him as he addressed the device. \"Echo Three to Echo Seven,\" Luke's voice crackled over the comlink. \"Han, old buddy, do you read me?\" Amidst a moment of static, a familiar voice responded. \"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?\" Han Solo's voice came through the comlink. \"Well, I finished my circle,\" Luke continued. \"I don't pick up any life readings.\" \"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser,\" Han's voice retorted. \"The sensors are placed, I'm going back.\" \"Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long,\" Luke concluded. Luke clicked off his transmitter, his focus returning to his Tauntaun. He patted the creature's head, soothing its nerves as he muttered, \"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?\" With a small device in hand, Luke began adjusting it, intent on his task. Suddenly, a large shadow fell over him from behind. He heard a monstrous howl and turned just in time to catch sight of an eleven-foot-tall Wampa Ice Creature lunging ferociously at him. --- Later, near Han Solo's space freighter, two robots came to a stop. Han and Chewbacca were struggling with the central lifters of their ship. Chewie grumbled irritably as Han admonished him for dismantling the equipment at that moment. \"Excuse me, sir,\" C-3PO interjected. Han turned to Chewie, saying, \"Put them back together right now.\" C-3PO continued, \"Might I have a word with you, please?\" Han's irritation was evident as he asked, \"What do you want?\" C-3PO responded, \"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.\" \"I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her,\" Han replied dismissively. \"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is,\" C-3PO informed. \"*I* don't know where he is,\" Han stated. \"*Nobody* knows where he is,\" C-3PO emphasised. \"What do you mean, '*nobody* knows'?\" Han asked incredulously. As the fading light outside the ice cave signalled the approach of night, Han glanced in its direction. The temperature continued to drop on the icy planet. \"Well, uh, you see...\" C-3PO began, hesitatingly. Realising that he needed more information, Han abruptly covered C-3PO's mouth with his hand as a deck officer approached. \"Yes, sir?\" the deck officer inquired. \"Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?\" Han asked urgently. The deck officer replied, \"I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.\" \"It's *possible*? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there,\" Han ordered. \"Yes, sir,\" the deck officer replied, hastening away. Han removed his hand from C-3PO's mouth, and the droid took the opportunity to ask, \"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?\" Han's response was straightforward: \"Why not?\" He moved away dismissively. C-3PO proceeded, \"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inside the Rebel base's main ice tunnel, the deck officer and his assistant rushed toward Han as he entered. \"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in,\" the deck officer reported. \"Not likely. Are the speeders ready?\" Han questioned. \"Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold,\" the deck officer explained. \"Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns,\" Han asserted. \"The temperature's dropping too rapidly,\" the deck officer warned. \"That's right. And my friends are out in it,\" Han replied firmly. Han mounted a Tauntaun. The deck officer and his assistant exchanged concerns about the extreme cold, but Han's determination was clear. \"The temperature's dropping too rapidly. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker,\" the deck officer warned Han. Han's retort was defiant: \"Then I'll see you in hell!\" With that, Han spurred his Tauntaun forward, venturing into the dark and bitter night of Hoth &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our heroes soon got news of the problem. They were part of a rebel group that has been instrumental in destroying Imperial ships at Kuat - ships that would surely have meant the end of the resistance, had they been allowed to take part in the Battle of Yavin. They were no strangers to taking the initiative. As soon as they heard Commander Skywalker was missing, they knew they had to act, despite the conservative concerns of middle command",

        "comment": "#The Curious Cases of Sigma19 ###It was late 3038. The Earth Empire had crumbled as a cohesive political force. In its wake came a certain freedom. But also uncertainty. Earths contribution to the Galactic community was not as fantastic as they sometimes allowed themselves to believe. Human sneakiness sometimes gave them an edge over the wisdom or inventiveness of other species, and allowed them to circumnavigate the will of brute aggression. But of course that by no means meant that everything they did with their influence was uncompromisingly beneficial. Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell. --- --- The Galactic Federation rose from the ashes of the Earth Empire as a way for the peoples of the Galaxy to support one another in their mutual interests, and deter aggressors. This brought new opportunities. Opportunities to tackle old problems. And even the opportunity to profit from facilitating the actions which were agreed upon. One thing looked certain. In some form or another, the Galactic Federation would form its own space navy. Andertenna was keen to lend its shipyards to the task. Ice Warriors and others were lined up to provide troops or training. And the Sigma system, lead by **Sigma19**, was anxious to provide a generous and affordable finance package. Of course each planet would have to play its part, putting up some of the wealth; but Sigma19 would underwrite the undertaking, and provide the initial cash flow; and provide certain guarantees and security to ensure the project would not flounder and nor would any individual planet find themselves in difficulty. A generous package indeed it was - but one surely they would also benefit from. Quite how was unclear. However, that was not the primary concern of our heroes. Prior to the Conference which had lead to the Galactic Navy being mooted, strange deaths had been reported on Sigma19. Reported and covered by one **James Carver** - acclaimed journalist. Unexplained deaths. Seemingly random. Cause unidentified. That much was fairly common knowledge in these parts. What was less well known is that around that time, little red flowers had been very popular. And James friends rather suspected these were related to the deaths. Indeed, they had seen the same flowers around when they had investigated deaths at the Galactic Federation conference. Now **K9** had recovered his stewardship of his TARDIS. He was relieved. For some time, Mr Wolf - a strange, unpredictable AI construct - had rather dominated the consol. He brought **James** and **Tatti** back to Sigma19. James was interested in following up on his former girlfriend, who seemed to have got involved with a criminal gang. Involved, in the sense that she had become its leader. Tatti was interested in following up on the strange deaths they had noted before. And they were all interested in ensuring the danger-hogs they had seen off previously were gone and had not caused any lasting damage. They were also curious to look into the activities of the current President, who was up for election, and seemed to be rather embroiled in intergalactic intrigue - if not directly involved in the said deaths. --- **Cass Willams** meanwhile was visiting Sigma19 for not entirely unrelated reasons. She followed the work of James Carver - and had been fascinated by what he had to say about the strange deaths on the planet. She had arrived here under her own steam to do her own little bit of detective work - and was delighted to learn that Mr Carver himself was actually here, in town, in person! She made it her business to find out where he was, so that they might compare notes. As she looked around the town, she noticed the particular characteristics of the local architecture. In the case of many buildings, low-cost homes occupied the ground floor. Above these, there was often a shop, or a business of some sort. On top of that was a level for parking. Ramps enabled the local cars to be driven up and parked; then little steps lead between the walkways on each level. Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden! It was considered a status symbol to own one of those grand apartments. The rent from the shop and lower cost housing helped pay for the whole block. It gave a new meaning to the phrase property ladder! If one could afford to invest in such a block, although it was an expensive outlay at the start, it was a regular income that paid for itself over time. It *did* mean that shopping was disjointed, with one or two shops in every block. Larger dedicated shopping blocks did exist, but they were frowned upon and seen as common. And the roof gardens were a sight to behold! --- In an opulent anteroom, Kirts sat. He insisted on being called Kirts. No title, no surname or forename. Just Kirts. He was the head of the Sigma19 diplomatic party. He was not happy. Krovon Muruch, the President of Sigma19, was unpredictable. Very difficult to lead a diplomatic mission with such an unpredictable leader. And this, of course, was a lose-lose. If Muruch messed up, that was on Kirts. But if Muruch did well, Kirts could claim no glory. **Jeb Richardson** stood before him. He was a military man, but he seemed to have some spark about him. Im on the security detail for Madiba Mandela, he explained. Oh yes. Madiba Mandela. The enigmatic, calm yet magnetic Earth delegate. A member of *his* party had Kirts respect. Now the conference is over, Richardson went on, I have been commissioned to travel with you, to officially represent Earths diplomatic concern with regards to the creation of the Galactic Navy. This seemed like a good move. Earth was taking Sigma19 seriously enough to send specific staff for the embassy to deal with Sigmas interest in the construction of the fleet. The direct approach indicated good faith. And handed Kirts a golden opportunity to build up a sound rapport. And so it was. Jeb Richardson travelled back to Sigma19, to take a desk at Earths embassy there",

        "comment": "####*Morning* Music echoed discordantly from the harsh walls of the shabby caf. #### The tattooed hoodlum had his feet up on the table like he owned the place. The proprietor was none too impressed. Then again, if it was not for his lot, this place would be out of business. That was the problem with Lagua. Too much of the same thing. Everyone scraped, no one really thrived. Tattoos spat a bit of particularly grisly tentacle into his chowder bowl. He had already demolished the chowder - now he was getting to grips with the fry up. Tentacle coils reclined against some thinly sliced baco bark, deep fried. Pulses, soaked in brine till they were fat and five times their normal size, swam about in an orange sauce that tasted vaguely of pimentoberries. Next to that was yam mashed up with spinachfern and onion, grilled until golden brown. His companion, a sharply dressed and moderately good looking man was content with just a mug of coffee nearly the size of his head, and brancakes. Both looked like they had made good use of the cheap booze sold in the hostelries preferred by the locals. The door swung open and another joined them, stooping low to fit through the doorway. He was a second generation hominid. The hominids were supposedly dna enhanced humans cultured for battle. By cultured, of course, they meant bred. However, breeding people was considered demeaning and unethical, so they did it anyway and called it culturing. The first generation designer soldiers did make good fighters, notwithstanding the fact they did not necessarily wish to fight. Their offspring in due course tended to have challenges brought on by their stretched and over-replicated genetics. They were often too ill-disciplined to train, of limited IQ, and too big to fit comfortably into normal society. It was perhaps not surprising that many of them got caught up in crime. Are we feeling better? asked tattoos, sardonically. He had heard all about the feisty female they had been tormenting the night before. After acting like the local gangster toughs and blocking her from leaving the bar until she had made good on an imagined delivery, she had shown herself more than a match for them, having placed her space boots firmly in his catalytic converter. Stuks only answer was to steal a baco bark slice from his friends plate, and ask gruffly for a large, warm vegetable juice. But seriously, though, the smoother one chuckled, You should have seen the looks on their faces. One of them looked completely freaked out! I dont know how they ever even got her into space! She was jumping at her own shadow. If I understand things correctly, said the proprietor, swivelling one of his eye stalks towards them in an accusatory manner, what she was jumping at was you treating her companion very roughly and insinuating some sort of a drugs deal, and then bringing a repeating phaser into the equation. If she *assumed* drugs, that is her lookout. I had chocolates in mind. And it was not a phaser. It was a nanodrill. Wed been using it for a job in the maintenance quarter. The three laughed uproariously. The Nephropthral hissed his disapproval, and went back to wiping the counter and preparing pancakes for the lunchtime rush. They thought it was a game - acting tough and limiting the off-worlders from their haunts. It kept things cheap and run the way they liked it - but it stopped the grafters who were trying to make a go of things from really progressing. Still, as they reminded him, if things got more successful, it would only mean more units being built and trying to muscle in - and that would drive places like his out. In a couple of years he would sell up and retire. Until then, he would put up and shut up. All the time the government - if that was not too strong a word for them - continued with its policy of *local security and resilence* things were unlikely to change. Resolved to the way things were, the Nephropthral chipped in with a story of his own, pincers clicking rapidly with amusement. > Anyway, you boys think you are smart, you missed the *real* entertainment last night. Down *The Malachite.* They were doing karaoke for prizes. The rye wine had been flowing pretty freely by then, and as you can imagine we were in for some screeching. Then this military type got up. Shed had some massive bust up with a commander - it had been very loud and provided quite an entertainment of itself. Hed left wearing a mayonnaise dressing and I did not get the impression she would be welcome back on his ship. Shed pretty much inhaled a pitcher by herself. Well, when she got up there I wondered how she could walk up there by herself, and I must say I think the microphone stand was giving her a fair amount of support. But you should have heard her sing! Voice like an angel and she brought the house down. Everyone was stunned, specially after the cacophony wed been treated to the half hour prior. --- #### --- Back on the , Cypreece checked the status log. As far as he could make out, most if not all of his team were back. Some of them under their own steam, and some of them having been assisted by port security. The authorities here were reasonably relaxed about visitors enjoying themselves a little too much. After all, that was all good business. The main thing was no one had got hurt, and Cypreece was glad they had enjoyed a good time. This was one of the most state-of-the-art ships in its class, turning heads and antenna wherever it went. But there was a limit to how comfortable a ship could ever be. It was always good to spend some time in a natural atmosphere and experience a change of scene. Still, the fact remained they had not done all they came for. He needed to get the full reports from the others to see if they had found any potential crew. They certainly did not seem to have sorted any additional equipment or food resources. There was an interesting log about Kyule having met her brother, and this possibly opening a door for an escort commission. If they could earn some money on the side that would pay for some upgrades and maybe improve the benefits package. More to the point it would give them another string in terms of keeping an eye out for nefarious activity, wherever it may appear. Cypreece was a moderately well-known cyborg. A tactician, diplomat and warrior. He was known equally for his compassion and his iron resolve. It seemed to Cypreece there were **all kinds of pirates** - in all walks of life. In fact he had a new definition of pirate. Pirate. One who ignores or exploits law to profit at the expense of others. ****",

        "comment": "##When are we, Mr Wolf? That was the uneasy question of the TARDIS crew as it arrived in a slightly unfamiliar cityscape. Slightly unfamiliar. They knew where they were, of course. But when? It did not quite look as it had when they left - and nor did they think this was a view from the citys past. So the future, then. But the question was, how far into it. And more to the point, what were *they* doing *then*. --- Where they were was Neonharper City, **Andertenna**. Andertenna. Magnificent and bleak. Bleak in the sense that, whilst not altogether unattractive from space, it was only barely supportive of life. And yet, it is home to many determined beings. And so magnificent in all that it has achieved. The Gonds colonized it, when their own planet became uninhabitable. They made a good fist of it. Their technology helped. Very smart methods of keeping sufficient breathable air within the atmosphere they lived in. Efficient use of energy. The use of hardy plants that could cope with the low moisture and thin air. And they were industrious. Hi tec businesses made the planet economically viable. Good quality manufacturing. Smart app programming. One city based on media producing both tourism and lucrative content output. And the jewel in the crown - Neonharper University. The planet employed a policy of open welcoming to any from other planets who wanted to live there, and nowhere was this more strongly in evidence than at the University. The brightest and best were encouraged to come and make this seat of learning one of the most recognised in the galaxy, and indeed beyond. One of its celebrated specialisms was Theoretical Time Travel. But then there was the scandal. The terrible business with the Dean, who had done such great things with the university, but who had been so despicable in other dealings. He made unsavoury business deals; committed Time crimes which threatened the whole planet; and in his bid to generate affordable power had committed atrocities which were shocking even though they were against criminals and enemy warriors. He had been arrested, of course, leaving the future of the University slightly uncertain. This was the situation the TARDIS crew had left behind. It was the one they expected to find upon their return. However, they quickly realise that they have returned to Andertenna some appreciable time after they had left.. --- **K9** was normally the one to pilot the TARDIS. He was, until that moment, the only one who fully understood it. Besides, he could interface directly with the TARDIS computer, enabling him to programme in destination coordinates and time with precise accuracy. However, on this occasion, Tash had been insistent that she be allowed to fly. --- **Tash** was a cyborg Time Marshal - intent on bringing to justice those who violated Time Laws, endangering the Universe. She had a particular interest in tracking down The Doctor, as he was to be a key witness at the trial of a criminal in the 52nd century. On their most recent mission, she had taken the full blast of a dalek gun - well, four to be precise. Of course, she stood no chance. But her mind, and most of her personality, was saved by the quick thinking of her friends, and she was given a new cyborg body. Through a twist of this process, a new personality was formed, dwelling within her cybernetic circuits - a personality that had become known as Mr Wolf. In fact, Mr Wolf seemed to have become the dominant character. --- Tash stands at the TARDIS console. She keys in the co-ordinates, and takes care to twine the rabbets in the correct configuration. *Set the controls for the heart of the sun* she sings, and hums softly to herself. Tatti looks at Rose. She hopes she does not mean this literally. --- **Tatti** is a malmooth - a former student of the University, whose studies of theoretical time travel certainly became a whole lot more practical when she met Rose and they were able to get the TARDIS going. One of her first uses of the technology when she got the chance was to save a friend whom she was originally forced to helplessly watch die... **Rose** is the child of River Song and The Doctor, although she was raised by Leela and her husband. She too was greatly hurt in the battle with the daleks - bearing wounds that may yet prove fatal... ------ &nbsp; &nbsp; The TARDIS dematerialised. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ---- ##The TARDIS re-materialises. The purply pink sky tells them it is Andertenna, and from the cityscape they know it is Neonhaper, but is not quite as they remember it. The Valley of Monuments is gone, as they remember it - and replaced with a huge - gigantuan - statue. Smoke billows out of the back of its head. Ludwig blanches a little as he recognises the face on the colossus that stares benignly over the city, and tries to distract the others from it. &nbsp; When *are* we, Mr. Wolf? they ask as they step out into a city that is too much changed for the time they have been away. Canned music plays from speakers that are dotted around the place. Some is rather pomp-filled music with a classical feel. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are also strains of a song that seems to be called I love Andertenna. The lyrics are saccharine and clearly populist political posturing. The tune cheesy and annoyingly catchy. Artificial sugar and cheese are never a good combination. There can be no doubt: &nbsp; &nbsp; This is far from Ludwigs greatest work. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the city itself, some buildings have been re-designed, and there are more posters and visual displays and statues similar to the one who looks down on them from the Valley of Monuments. And now, none can miss who it is. It is Ludwig. Or should that be, Sir Ludwig. Or more accurately yet, it would appear - *President* Ludwig. Ludwig has gone from pale to crimson, and is studying his shoes. How embarrassing. I appear to have become the President. --- **Prof Dogwa** is running a community class in the grand entrance atrium of the University. She approves of this space. Although the natural light of Andertenna is not bright, it is best to make the best use of it possible. And the atrium makes for a pleasant circulating of the fortified air. She is showing some slides in support of her talk about conservation. She is a tree person from Cheem; a people who know better than most about the importance of supporting biodiversity, and supporting natural eco systems. Of course, the situation on Andertenna is reverse to what has been experienced on many planets. Elsewhere, a habitable planet has been made more and more inhospitable by the greed and carelessness of its custodians. Andertenna was inhospitable from the start - Dogwa of Cheem hopes that her experience and learning can help a new generation understand what they need to do if their planet is to become ecologically stronger. She glances over at the great, imposing statue of President Ludwig. *Not that*, she thinks to herself. The trail of smoke is very high up - high enough to perhaps be unnoticed by most - and, to be fair, in the grand scheme of things, not that damaging. She understands that the President needed somehow to replace the unacceptable..power source that had been there previously. However, for all that, a better alternative needs to be found - and soon. As she looks, she notices something odd. Was that - no, that can not have been there before. That has just appeared. A strange blue building, out on the wasteland, not far from the statue, has suddenly appeared. It was surely not there earlier - she would have seen it. Yet no dusty disturbance to suggest it had been somehow dragged there - and what would it take to move it. Maybe - no, thats silly. Still, she is near the end of her talk. Perhaps she will investigate.",
        "writing_prompt": "The TARDIS crew arrives in a future version of a familiar city, only to discover that one of their own has somehow become its president, complete with towering statues and propaganda songs. But how did this happen, and what secrets lie behind the smoke billowing from the colossal monument?"
