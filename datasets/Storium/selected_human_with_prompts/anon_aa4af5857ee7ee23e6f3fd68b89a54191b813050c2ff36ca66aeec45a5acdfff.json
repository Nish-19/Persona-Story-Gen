One of the free city-states, Belgaerd is a stewpot of different races and cultures, and a bastion of research into magical theory and cutting edge artificing. Industry tycoons make their fortunes in its towering buildings and movie stars throw parties in elegant rooftop gardens. It is the jewel of the west, a shining example of civilization for all the world.\n\nBut it wasn't so long ago that Belgaerd was an untamed wilderness, a small, struggling township kept alive by bold adventurers, a tenacious city guard, inspired mages, and the dedication of the faithful. The rise of technology and ubiquitous magic makes those days of danger seem far away, but despite forced integration of the civilized races' long-time enemies--trolls, orcs, goblins, and others--the streets are just as dangerous as the dungeons they replaced ever were. \n\nBe careful the streets you choose to walk and the monsters you choose to trust.

It was an easy town to go crazy in; to go crazy for. Detective Nick L. Dime found that out in the moments before he died. In the moments after he did what every person hopes theyd do, given a similarly piss poor hand of cards. Jorgin was gonna miss the kid. The gruff, old dwarf had high hopes for him, back when they met. Young, but smart, with a good nose for sussing out the whys and wherefores, and a keen mind for the magic. Too good, as it turned out. Hed have made a damn fine detective, words Jorgin was glad he could offer to his folks in complete honesty. Kid even managed to close that first case. Just a shame that it closed him, too. Yeah, hed miss him, but it wasnt the first partner Jorgin had buried. Not likely to be the last, either. Belgaerd had no end to her appetite, would happily grind up and swallow the next sucker offered up to her, like some kind of chthonic goddess gobbling up sacrificial lambs with wanton abandon. In fact, that was probably a more apt description than hed care to admit. It was a hungry city, alright; and a city of hunger. Want, want, want. Right now, Jorgin wanted a drink. Belgaerd never quite went full prohibition, like her neighbors, but there were limits on the kind of elixir he could partake of. He had a thirst for the real hard stuff at the moment, and he had a flask of it waiting for him in his pocket. Almost didnt care who saw; almost did it just to see if he could start a fight out of it. But no, kids folks were still here, kids sister still bawling up a storm to rival gloomy clouds overhead. He turned to leave, but found his way blocked by Bart. Sergeant Bartholomew Dunn was the only person in the City Guard more curmudgeonly and disagreeable than Jorgin. Also the only one as experienced. The satyr had been doing this work since there was work to be done, and had approximately as positive an outlook on it as Jorgin. As a result, they tended to get along spectacularly, grumbling and complaining about the same dragon-sized piles of crap set before them. Bart probably shouldve been Captain of the Guard a couple decades ago, butas the jokes goesnobody on the City Council could stand the clacking of his hooves on marble floors. So instead, Bart got all the rough cases. Which meant Jorgin got all the roughest of the rough. Right now, Bart had that look on his face that meant Jorgin wasnt going to get that drink. Not just yet, anyway. Where? he asked. Bart didnt answer right away. He stamped the ground and fiddled with his ludicrously long goatee, staring out over the end of Nicks funerary proceedings. Satyrs grew beards like billy goats, but it was terrible idea to poke fun of it. This one got to you, he said. Didnt he. It wasnt stated as a question, so Jorgin didnt answer. Not until Bart fixed him with a steady, steely stare. If you need time off, you can have it. Youre due. He snorted. Youre always hexing due.",

They created bioengineering monstrosities, had mastered interstellar and atmospheric flight-capable aircraft, and could even reach out mind-to-mind and control their enemies. Earth never stood a chance, though we still fought.\n\nAt first, they toyed with us; we still don\u2019t know why. They conducted a shadow war in small strikes, prodding and poking us as though to see what would happen. Eventually, though, they came in force, and one by one they demanded the surrender of our nations. The first to surrender created the \u2018ADVENT Coalition\u2019, which laughably pretended to govern *with* the aliens, as partners. We all knew better. \n\nOpen warfare was swift and brutal. They bombed our cities with a toxic fog that rendered them unlivable, leaving anyone caught within to devolve into a nightmarish echo of their own humanity, forcing the rest of us to flee to the open countryside. Scattered, without our satellites, without anywhere to concentrate our forces, it was only a matter of time.\n\nThey decided to stay. Under the ADVENT Coalition, they rebuilt the cities that they cared to in their own design, to their own sensibilities, stripping them of human culture and tradition. There, humans are kept like favored pets: cared for, nourished, but never let off leash. They control information, health, food, and of course all armed forces.\n\nHowever, their control is not complete. Outside the cities, the aliens don\u2019t seem to care much what the rest of us do. We eke out a life however we can, struggling day-to-day, and perhaps they think that means they can ignore us.\n\nThey have always underestimated us.\n\nMore and more of us are answering the call to resist. We don\u2019t have much to turn against them, but we find ways: by learning where supplies are kept, when transports are running, who their important personnel are, and where our own prisoners have been taken. We gather this precious information, and we disseminate it to anyone with the means and will to fight back; anyone willing to try and hobble their horrific machine.\n\nThey control the planet, but they don\u2019t yet control us, and as long as there are still people able to fight, we\u2019ll support them. No matter the cost.\n\n---\n\nThis is one of three [parallel](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-twilight-kingdom/) [stories](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-violent-souls/) that act as a sequel to [XCOM: Falls the Shadow](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/). This story focuses on the survivor communities that comprise the non-combat Resistance to the ADVENT coalition government. They live a hard life in the dangerous wilds outside ADVENT\u2019s control, struggling day-to-day between basic survival, dodging ADVENT patrols and crackdowns, maintaining human culture, and supporting the ongoing fight to be free. \n",

[Where would you go?]( --- It started slowly, at first: a UFO sighting here, a blurry photo of a creature never before seen on earth over there, and scattered reports of clandestine strike teams arriving to quickly suppress and clean up strange anomalieslike Men in Black if they had a SEAL Team Six. It seemed so preposterous, so impossible, that it was easy to dismiss, even with the evidence accumulating by the day. Our own culture had trained us to do it, after all. Soon enough, though, it was impossible to ignore: the abductions, the attacks on cities, the steadily accumulating footage of monstrous creatures and advanced weaponry discharged in public, the *spaceships*. Humanity had finally made contact with aliens, and they were *not* friendly. There was a lot of fear in those days, when so little was known. The aliens would make a move, an attack, and humanity could only *respond,* and that response was inevitably XCOM; everyone knew the name eventually, and realized as well that the United Nations had devised this program in secret decades ago, had been *expecting* thisand had kept it quiet as long as they could. Humanitys defenders were unknown, unelected, and unaccountable. Our fate was out of our hands. And humanity was clearly outmatched, though it would still be months before the aliens decided to leverage the full force of their technological superiority against us. In that time, they worked in secret, with agents who walked among us. We didnt know it yet, but they were hard at work convincing the powerful people of the world that the best way, the safest way, the *only* way humanity could endure this invasion was to capitulate to the aliens demands: to lay down their arms, welcome the invaders, and turn over control of our cities and militaries and institutions to them. In return, the aliens offered them a veritable paradise without hunger or disease or war. Humanity could have everything it ever longed for, fought for, *killed* forexcept its freedom. The aliens had arrived in March. In July, the ADVENT Coalition was formed from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, newly united under a single government both human and alien. Other nations joined them: Belgium, the Netherlands, Guatemala, Belize, and more. But before October was gone, all pretense was finished: ADVENT announced that any nation that wouldnt welcome the aliens and join the Coalition willingly would be *forcibly* brought into it. Open war. This time, the aliens didnt hold back. Their advanced weaponry, their monstrous shock troops, their spectacularly advanced spacecraft, their *mind control*. Humanity fought valiantly, but it was never a question of *if* but *when* humanity would fall. By March, 2016, there was no meaningful organized government left on Earth to fight them. ADVENT declared the world unified, finally at peace, and set to work rebuilding the world as the aliensthe *Elders*--envisioned it. But like everything else about ADVENT, it had always been a lie. --- In the fraught, early chaos of those days, all the worlds concerns fell away and distilled into just one: survive. Though the details of circumstances differed, humans everywhere *did* manage to persevere despite what ADVENT and the aliens could bring to bear. Not enough for our institutions, perhaps, but enough that individuals everywhere yet lived who could remember where they were, and what they did when that primal necessity was all that remained. They *survived.*",

It seemed someone had infiltrated through every known form of physical security and gotten direct access to her network. Her *real* network, not one of the dupes or paltry business nets, and was causing merry chaos with the electronics all over her state-of-the-art citadel. No, not state-of-the-art. *Beyond* state-of-the-art. There were marvels of innovation and technological mastery that hadnt even been dreamed of in most quarters, her own proprietary designs known to a scant few, but here some mystery hacker had invaded them without physical access, without a signal, without even a *program* to interface with. *A ghost in the machine.* But her physical security was suffering, too. With cameras fritzing and automated turrets stuttering, targeting each other, and doors randomly opening and closing, the most formidable of her defenses were lasciviously spreading their legs to the two men casually wrecking their way through basement, and subbasement, and sub-subbasement Heading directly for her vault. She had security personnel, of course. Robots, chiefly, but a few biological personnel that shed considered a necessary precaution in an age of super hackers, electrically charged do-gooders, and technologically potent aliens. Unfortunately, the ex-hero whipping fire like it was going out of style was handling them quite well, even if he hadnt the support of the other man behind him. That other man looked suspiciously like one of her rivals chief operatives, though of course it was difficult to say for certain, what with the all-black, face-obscuring outfit. Still, well-known operatives had a certain style about them, a costume if you will, and this fit the bill. Yes, it was definitely a very well-coordinated strike deep into the heart of her power, and there was very little Kumiko could do about it, even with all her resources and wild intelligence. Exactly as shed planned. --- The thing about being, in essence, a poltergeist was that it afforded a whole new playing field to operate on. Lea had been given very specific instructions about where and how to strike Kumikos defenses and what electronics to wreak havoc with, a thing Lea had a remarkable amount of experience in disrupting--mostly whenever it seemed most likely to ruin her haunted murderers day. But though Regis had an impressive setup of his own, it really didnt compare to a top-of-the-line, professional operation like this. There were fascinating intricacies to the Kurosawa systems, layers of redundancies and firewalls (almost literal in her plane of battle), and aggressive countermeasures. Right. Countermeasures. It struck Lea, immersed in playing poltergeist with a truly enormous haunted house, that Kumiko hadnt really gone into a great degree of detail about *those.* Lea had learned the hard way that so-called black intrusion countermeasures (or ICE) could apparently be blended with mystical elements to create what amounted to spiritual defenders of a completely electronic creation. At least, thats what shed managed to deduce from what little shed overheard during the briefing, and the fact that she was being actively hunted by very angry, very tangible programs. With teeth. How did they even *get* teeth? Still, there was a job to do, and a pressing need to not find out what those teeth could actually do to her. It shouldnt be much longer before the others could break through --- Another door flew from its frame, crashing into the room beyond. Kieran and the operative behind him stepped over the wreckage of robots and guards knocked cold to survey the next hallway impeding their route to the vault. The automated defenses seemed non-functional here, which meant their sort-of-hacker was doing her job, but there was likely to be another wave of physical defenses at any moment. The very best of Kurosawa Robotics would be headed their way--black ops cybernetic soldiers, killbots, and who knows what else? Well, *they* knew. Kumiko herself had prepped them with full schematics of her most prized creations, recently stolen from one of her datacenters, apparently by a rival. And to some extent that was true but the secrets had found their way to them, as well. All the weaknesses, weaponry, tricks and exploits. Of course, it was still no picnic. Kumiko knew her trade, and she needed this to look good. There was a reason nobody had ever tried this before and succeeded. But there was a first time for everything. Of course, there was a last time for everything, too. The sound of machinery thundered from around a bend in the corridor...",

        "comment": "##March 1st, 2015 They called it *Operation: Secret Fist,* which was strangely appropriate, because the result of it felt a bit like a punch to the gut. Aliens were real. They were *hostile.* They were right in XCOMs backyard. It seemed like dumb luck that the first alert of extraterrestrial activity was so close, but that proved to be wishful thinking. So Paulo was one of *three* sites across the globe that had a sudden alien incursion--or so the later report from the Council of Funding Nations said--but it was this closest one that XCOM scrambled the Skyranger and four operatives to respond to. It had happened only a minute *before* the decision to officially activate the XCOM Project came down from an emergency call by the Council. Soon, the base was alive with more activity than the secluded complex had ever experienced in the entirety of its existence. Only the incredible calm in the Commanders base-wide announcement held the place shy of complete chaos--that, and a deeply ingrained military discipline among so many of the personnel, and a wide understanding that Chief Ndaba (who still preferred Lieutenant Colonel Ndaba or simply Sir) would not tolerate *anyone* shirking duty. Even if alien metal were falling from the sky. Which, reportedly, it was. By the time the team returned from the op--alive, but with one significant casualty sustained--orders had already been issued to most of the base personnel and the experimental Skyranger found itself competing for space with a flurry of black helicopters hurrying in and out of the base, transporting people, supplies, and equipment. The good news was that XCOM had funding now. The base, long in a state of ambivalent idleness, with hollowed out underground chambers simply waiting to be turned into usable facilities, was now at the tender mercies of a mobilized construction crew. Word was Felipe had been the first person the Commander spoke with after the emergency call from the Council. Staff had been roused in the middle of the night, long-dormant machinery started up, and the first of the helicopters sent out for additional manpower. Many more followed. XCOM suddenly had much greater needs: More people meant more space, meant more food, meant more *everything.* Manny Lee found himself in the kitchen far earlier than usual, brusquely informed he was now a supervisor, and set loose on whatever culinary conscripts they could muster. A little after dawn, the Council Liaison herself arrived. Thered never been a Liaison on site before. Thered never been a *need* for one. But the Council was throwing real resources at XCOM for the first time in years, and they werent about to let their eyes on it remain distant and unfocused. Iris Li had one priority on her agenda, of course: the Commander. But while the pair talked, work continued: Research & Development had a sudden need to clear all personal projects and experiments to make way for mission critical work, for not longer after the Operatives returned came the first batch of alien salvage from the field: fragments of technology, alien cadavers, materials samples, and a very curious canister of orange fluid. It was this last that caught the Chief Scientists eye. Dr. Indira Sahni, for her relatively benign appearance and friendly demeanor, had a reputation to match Ndabas: shed been with the Project since its creation, and many believed it was international interest in her experimental weapons research that largely drove it over the years. Right now, though, it was the orange fluid that interested her. I want everything catalogued and stored securely before we begin. *Be careful.* Reports from the field are that the alien weapons exploded on their deaths. *Dont* cause any unplanned detonations in my lab. And that was that. Then she fired of a priority dispatch for the Commander and the Operations Chief: >I need Dr. Darya Ansari acquired for the Project. Address attached. And another of Ndabas choppers was away. Down in Engineering, the team faced an urgent request to produce two field-ready versions of cutting edge technology theyd only ever built one rudimentary prototype for. It was a Medkit, but not in any conventional fashion--and it was needed. One grievously injured operative had been pulled out of the Skyranger. It was their job to prevent another. *At least its not a weapon,* Declan thought. But it was still going to be a pain in the ass to work out the kinks and make adjustments with the new intel from the field. On and on the list of jobs went. From cutting edge research to simple logistics, there was no end to the support needed to suddenly activate the XCOM Project. In fact, the only people who *didnt* have a seemingly endless list of things to do were the Field Operatives themselves. Four of them sat ready to respond to the next call for action; the others were told to relax or pitch in where you can. Nobody had any idea when the aliens would strike next, but after their initial strikes, theyd gone completely silent. The hours passed, and the skies remains quiet, but it couldnt last. The aliens would be back. And when they were, it would be four of the field operatives who would face them.",

He thought it was fitting. He shouldve recognized it for an omen. --- ***Meredith-*** When she opened her eyes, she knew it was wrong. It was the *sound*--or rather, the total lack of white ship noise that accompanied any warship like this one. If it wasnt something mechanical on the fritz, itd be the hum of air scrubbers, or the subtle vibrations from other crew wandering around nearby, or just the thrum of voices. But there was nothing. It was all silent. The other bunks were empty, and undisturbed. The viewport still showed space, but there was something off about the stars. It was like shed awoken in a simulation of her quarters, all uncanny valley, but someone had forgotten to get the small details right. So if she wasnt on the ship where the hell *was* she? --- ***Hallam-*** He left Faerie, driven only by the desire to find some place as broken as he felt, passing through the tree and emerging into an aspen grove, already aflame. The smoke stung and clawed at his lungs, but there was more of it than there was fire, when he could gather his senses. There *was* fire, though, a young blaze just beginning to find its feet. He knew that with a little time, itd have the kind of momentum that would be hard to stop. The air was too dry, but there wasnt much windyet. There was a chance to stop this early. The strangest part, though, was that as Hallam peered around the grove to get a sense of its scope and his surroundings, he wasnt sure whether he was really outdoors, or indoors; there were *shelves* somewhere behind the smoke, nestled amid the foliage. And *books.* At least, for a moment, it seemed like they were books Books burned pretty well, too, though. --- ***Kyllian-*** He swore his allegiance to darkness, destruction, and chaos. He banished the tyranny of light, heard the goddess scream into the aether, and found himself immersed in darkness. Alone. Plucked out by Maelevon to another plane? Was that part of the deal? Or was this something in retaliation, some cost for what hed done? Was this punishment? Sacrifice? Hed never killed a goddess before Hello? he called again, and the word echoed back at him. Slowly, though, the darkened halls resolved into something more. Maybe it was a gift of darkness, or maybe his eyes were just adjusting. In the dimness, he could make out wallsno, *shelves.* Vellum scrolls and old leatherbound tomes adorning them, not unlike an ancient, sacred temple archive of some kind. Though never had he heard of one so *vast* His vision continued to clear; the lamps lit around him, dimmed behind him, but they were getting brighter. All they revealed, though, was more of the same. A seemingly infinite library stretched onward. But at least it had branching paths. --- ***Rosalita-*** She rode as if her life depended on itit did, incidentallytrying to remember her geography, to know where to meet back up with her boys; with Tommy. But she hadnt counted on the storm. There shouldnt have been such a storm, but it came upon her with sudden and terrible speed, and soon she was immersed in it. Thunder sounded in a cacophony around her, lightning flashed and disoriented her, *Satanas* vocally expressed his dismay. Soon, she was well and truly lost. It mightve been five minutes, or it mightve been hours, but eventually a shape loomed ahead out of the haze of rain and lashing winds: a building. It was better than nothing. --- ***Monika-*** Not in a million years ...a million years ...million years The sound of her own voice spiraled around and around, growing faster, like an audio recording getting warped by some mechanical aberration. It spiked in volume, growing faster, warping, overwhelming the senses. **...illion yearsnyearsears-EARS-RRRRSSSS** And then there was nothing. No recording. No cameraman. Monika was seated exactly where she remembered sitting during the audition tape, except all the doors to other rooms were curiously absent. In their place, where the cameraman had been, there was a hazy ripple through the air. All shed meant to do was *touch* it, but with a heady rush, everything flipped around on her, and suddenly Monika was on the *other side* of the haze in the air. In front of her was a large, full-lengthpainting? Paintingof the room shed given the interview in. She wasnt in it. Left and right, as far as the eye could see, there were other large paintings.*They* had people in them. Some of them didnt look human, though; many, *many* of them looked like theyd been plucked out of sci-fi or fantasy movies. The place was otherwise quite nice, like high end art gallery, with lots of marble, polished stone, pillarsand it was *cold*. And empty, except for her, and all the paintings. Was thispart of the whole thing? Somehow? --- ***McCoy-*** He was in a cemetery. It wasnt a *normal* cemetery, either; it was about as stereotypically dark and ominous as one could be, which strongly suggested a dream or something more chemically-enhanced. If it were a movie, itd have been criticized for being too over-the-top: the thick fog, the greenish luminescence, the leaning tombstones and looming mausoleumsall the goddamn *ghosts*. Most of them werent clear enough to make out, but they sure as hell were there: their voices a muted murmur across the wind, distinguishable only as heavy with regret and sorrow; their shapes more movement than imagea hint of something at one periphery, a rush of wind past his shoulder, that kind of thing. He could *almost* make them out. They seemed to be getting clearer, after all. --- ***Romy-*** She was alone in what should have been the bookstore: no Barty, no Wainwright. Another look around assured her that it was *definitely* too long an aisle, far too large for the space, and with more branching aisles than she remembered. And the air! It was as if a vast space had opened up around her, and the stuffy bookstore air was rushing out, replaced by the coolness of the outdoors. Only *that* wasnt true, either. As far as she could tell, she was still indoors. The bookstore was getting very large, now. It was getting difficult to tell which direction was which, too; despite the seemingly unending secondhand books and diverse array of volumes, there was a sameness to one row after the next that made orienting oneself challenging. It would be easy to get lost in a place like this. --- ***Verne-*** He wasnt sure exactly what went down with the people he was with, the folks what had a gun on them, and the feller stealing supplies. Had there been a scuffle? Had they run? He had a vague recollection of running down a slender side passage in that cavern, trying to get well and clear of any firefight. But it had just gone on, and on, and now it seemed like hed been plunging through this tunnel for ages. It was looking less and less like a cavern, too. The walls were turning from rough rock into smooth stone, and then into brick; the floor from an irregular incline to a ramp to stairs; overhead, at some point, a naked bulb suspended, offering a struggling light. Place looked more like a cellar or basement than it did a cave, all of a sudden. Hello? His voice didnt echo, which was the first surprising thing; the second was that he started hearing *other* voices up ahead. Coursevoices could also be trouble. Some of em just were. No sooner did Verne reckon he didnt have much choice but to head forward anyway, when lo and behold, a branch in the tunnelor rather, another corridoropened up to one side. Another way. But should he take it, or head to the voices? Could be the folk he was traveling with; could be the devil, too, come to collect. It sure was getting weird enough for it",

        "comment": "#Act I - Enemy Within ##March 2029 *What you see is not real* *Those who know will not tell* *All is lost, sold your souls* *To this [brave new world]( --- It was a day not unlike many others in City 31 (formerly Pittsburgh, briefly New Pittsburgh). The weather was temperate, the streets clean, and everything seemed to be running like clockwork. Viewing things only superficially, one could be mistaken for assuming the whole city ran with idyllic precision and ease. But the devil, as always, was in the details. Not that many people talked about devils anymore. Once upon a time, many had insisted that the Elders and the other species they guided were devils, and that had since been proven wildly false. Now, people talked less and less of superstition and supernatural belief. After all, with the miracles occurring every day, with the floating images of near-angels in their own midst, it wasnt really a matter of *belief* at all. Still, despite the decline of religion, St. Anthonys Chapel still stood. Thered been a lot of talk about decommissioning it, using its valuable place for something of more tangible use to the common goodbut there were also a lot of people who seemed to *like* the old chapel. It had history; symbolism; meaning. And lots of old relics, apparently. Words come from above, City 31s Content Director explained to the other media content planners**Vesta** includedat the daily meeting. Theyre going to repurpose the site of the chapel, and weve been asked to help the populace understand this decision. In other words, they had to put a positive spin on what was surely going to piss off a segment of the populace. Nobody wanted Lancers getting called in to suppress a wave of unrest. **Libby** was present as well, as one of the more important go-fers not otherwise preoccupied with other matters. Her biggest project remained the youth group, and that didnt consume her time until much later in the day. But even if she wasnt making decisions, she could still offer inputor at least get people to say things that might have some utility later on. --- Elsewhere in the city, **Jon** was also struggling with the fallout of this impending decision, albeit unexpectedly. Thatsnot what we do, he explained to the woman in front of him, pleading with him to take the box she held out. Youre looking for the museum. They wont take it, she said hurriedly. They say its not part of theiruh, how did he put it?--Not part of the legacy theyre conserving. Please, I just dont want these to be *destroyed*, they have spiritual value. They are *actual fragments of saints*. Even if you dont believe, surely you can see the historical and cultural value. But this is a library Cant you juststore them somewhere? Keep them safe? And when weve found somewhere to keep our faith going, well come get them. Please? It was *probably* doable, but it was certainly not one of his official duties and would be deeply frowned upon if an ADVENT administrator ever found out. That could have serious repercussions. Not that they usually paid much attention to things out of public sight --- Shiblon had never seemed very keen on the Chapel repurposing project, but now that it seemed all but certain, he seemed *very* busy. **Layla** hadnt seen him at work quite this early before. Not that he wasnt diligent, but this did seem unusual. Maybe hed thought his counter proposal would go through, and now that it wasnt, he had work to catch up on. That was probably it. The extra quiet in the morning meant she had time to reflect on how theyd come to where they are, though, and that wasnt necessarily bad. Sometimes it did seem to be too good to be true --- One idea getting tossed around in the media meeting included another initiative underway in the city: a special opportunity for workers at the newly refurbished gene therapy clinic to collaborate with some of the manufacturing districts best and brightest on a new prototype implant. There was admittedly some question surrounding how seriously to take this initiative: how much of it was an educational opportunity, and how much of it was a serious undertaking. After all, the projects directors had specifically assigned very young (though up-and-coming) specialists to the initiative. Included among them were **Chloe** Kethry, **Lucas** Almeida, and Alec Fischer. They were all near enough in age to already know one another from school and aptitude evals, all respectably skilled (even very impressive, by some marks), but why not more senior personnel? Whatever the reason, these youths and others had been given the project. The goal: review a proposed prototype implant for efficacy and see if they could improve on the design. Of course, it wasnt expected to be easy, and no small part of that was because they hadnt actually been *told* much about the implant, or its purpose. They knew it was intended for the Peacekeeping division, but not precisely *how*. Theyd been given schematics, one copy of the device itself, and several benchmark test results. It seemed they were expected to strictly focus on the mechanics of the implant. Though that didnt mean that they couldnt speculate --- **Cole** was expected to be in classsuch as it was for the citizens on sub-basic income, living out in Shankville outside the walls. He had half a mind to skip it; he was already eyeing an early jump into the workforce, hoping to make some extra credits out in the meat vats, like some of his peers already were. The only thing that kept him from jumping in full force was that he was also distracted training for his debut fight. It was *tonight.* How could he focus on book learning when he had to get ready for his trial bout tonight? It was set to be in Old Town, of course, deep in the tunnels where such unauthorized fights could go unnoticed. But *everyone* was going to be there. Anyone worth a damn, anyway. Maybe even Did his eyes deceive him? There, standing at the Switchyard station, waiting for her own train (probably to somewhere much better) was none other than semi-famous street racer **Starlyn** Roth (though she did above board racing as well, Cole was of course most interested in the tunnel races she sometimes engaged in). Outside the fighting world, racers were the next greatest thing. And right now, it seemed Starlyn was being stalked and followed by two grim, stony-faced individuals in bland, dark clothes. A more astute observer mightve realized these were ADVENT administrators intent on having a chat with Starone could only guess whybut Cole didnt have all that much experience with city administrators. Whether he understood who they wereor even caredremained to be seen. If Star was in trouble, maybe it didnt matter from who. --- **Maya** was preparing for school, too and deeply considering something so terrible that shed never before dared to contemplate it: skipping class. It wasnt that ADVENT was particularly punishing about missing schoolat least in small incrementsbut it was her obligation to be there! And Maya hated shirking her responsibilities. And what if lack of perfect attendance somehow disqualified her from the Peacekeeper program? But there were extenuating circumstances. Her parents and Uncle Barrett were up to somethingshed heard them whispering againand she *really* wanted to know what it was. She suspected it had something to do with this weird, special new project Alec was getting because of how perfectly smart he was; Maria said Lucas was on it, too, and that just made her *more* curious. Now, it *was* Marias idea to go snoop and figure out what their older brothers were up to, so maybe it wouldnt go too badly for her if they were caught. As long as they were finished before youth group meeting in the afternoon, maybe it wouldnt be too bad --- Speaking of Uncle Barrett, he was already hard at work. He and **Ren** worked the same beat for manufacturing: the resource retrieval, repair, supply, resupply, and other logistics stuff that, for the most part, nobody else wanted to do. It generally involved a lot of running around, a lot of sifting through databases, squinting at serial numbers, conversations with other employees whod forgotten to check equipment out, and so on. In Rens case, she was perpetually stuck with the job because of her many, many.*many* infractions. A problem worker, it was something of a miracle that they kept her on at all, except that she did wind up with a very impressive recovery ratedespite seeming to constantly lose datapads. Barrett, on the other hand Ren was never really sure how Barrett got stuck with the job, but he actually seemed content with it. Better than sticking my hand under a giant laser, hed chortle. Secretly, Ren wondered if it wasnt that both of them shared the same sort of miserable past: they were both survivors from across the ocean, from nations that had surrendered to ADVENT rapidly and wasted no time in breaking up their families. Barrett had recovered most of his, but Ren had always suspected that, like her, he was still looking for others. And logistics was a decent place to color outside the lines a little, as it were. On this particular morning, Barrett seemed especially involved insomething. He was being cagey about it, which meant it probably wasnt strictly within their assigned duties. But maybe Ren could tease the information out of him.",

        "post_title": "In April of 1919, an expedition led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle set out from New York with ambitions to explore tombs in Egypt. By October of that same year, the expedition was feared missing; in the following year, the site of their massacre was uncovered, albeit with many lingering questions--and bodies unaccounted for.\n\nNow it is January of 1925. Your good friend Jackson Elias, a noted investigative writer on the occult--particularly obscure death cults--has called on you and others to meet with him in New York.  \n\nHe tells you it's about the Carlyle Expedition.\n\nHe tells you he needs reliable help--your help--to aid his investigation.\n\n---\n\nThis story is a long adventure that will focus on investigating a mystery, foiling a world-spanning, malevolent plan, and confronting cosmic and existential horror. It is long, it is involved, and it is likely to get hopelessly dark at times.\n\nThis story is also an experiment in translating a well-known Call of Cthulhu roleplaying campaign into the Storium model. You don't require any familiarity with the RPG itself to participate. There will be no dice rolls, no character sheets; the objective is to use Storium to provide a more narrative experience for this well-loved adventure. In fact, I would like to avoid players who are already familiar with the campaign if at all possible. \n\nWhat *will* help is familiarity with H.P. Lovecraft or the Cthulhu Mythos generally. Lovecraftian Horror, while it often contains elements of traditional horror and psychological horror, also delves into cosmic horror--the terror of coping with mankind's insignificance in a vast, incomprehensible universe in which humans are a tiny, negligible part.\n\nBut there is hope there. This is not intended to be a story of never-ending darkness and failure. It is a struggle in the face of overwhelming odds in a desperate bid to stem the tide of vile, corrupt powers.\n\nThough failure, too, is a possible result.\n\n---\n\n##The Story So Far\n\n**Chapter 1** - Eight individuals find themselves called or drawn to the hotel room of Jackson Elias, world-traveling author of occult volumes detailing the horrific exploits of death cults. Known for skepticism and in depth research, the man now sounds desperate and fearful and in need of their help to research events of the Carlyle Expedition, a doomed journey undertaken by rich playboy Roger Carlyle, with several others, which led to a massacre of all members in the Kenyan uplands. \n\nBut at the prescribed meeting, the investigators instead discover the author, for many their *friend,* killed in ritualistic fashion. They kill or drive off the murderers, and find scattered around the room numerous clues as to what Elias was involved in. It is agreed by all that they must take up the investigation he meant for them and, if possible, avenge his death. Armed with little more than fragmentary references to New York, London, Egypt, Kenya, Shanghai, and even Polynesia, the investigation begins.\n\n**Chapter 2** - The investigators begin pursuing leads from Elias's hotel room, first venturing to Harvard and Arkham, but emerging with little to show for it. They then look closer to home at Emerson Imports and the files of Dr. Huston, of the Carlyle Expedition. It soon becomes clear that Elias was interested in a place called Ju-Ju House, which Emerson handles imports for.\n\n**Chapter 3** - The investigators narrow their focus to the Ju-Ju House, a store of authentic African tribal items buried in the back alleys of Harlem. After a cursory investigation, they opt to break-in at night in full force, discovering rather more than they bargained for: a death cult, unearthly creatures, unnatural abominations, and prisoners meant for something hideous. It becomes apparent that the mystery Elias was onto involved more than they ever could have guessed, almost beyond belief itself.\n\nAfter their liberation, Dean Chang and Alice Early join the investigators in their search for answers.\n\n**Chapter 4** - The cult broken up, the murders solved--at least on the surface--the investigators have a brief moment of respite. All clues lead outside of the country, now, and so it is agreed that they will start with London--nearest, and Elias's last visit before New York.\n\nLizzie, Andrew, and Ruth leave the group, the toll of the dark mystery proving too much. The others bid a final farewell to Elias at his funeral, where they meet Elias's publisher, who entrusts them with Elias's notes from Kenya. Some also peruse the remains of the Ju-Ju House, but there is little left to discover there except the haunting memory of the thing in the basement.\n\n**Chapter 5** - The investigators arrives in London in order to ascertain the activities of Jackson Elias while there. They interview one of his old friends and Edward Gavigan, director of the Penhew Foundation (whose namesake, Sir Aubrey Penhew, was killed in the Carlyle Expedition massacre). It appears another string of ritualistic murders is underway here--still unsolved--that Jackson had a keen interest in, believing it to be the work of a death cult.",

        "comment": "#Jackson Elias ##January 15th, 1925 - New York City, NY >*The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes. *Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe All right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harrys debts with the right*persuasion.* Thatd be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person. Hell, maybe theyd just plug Harry once she was done. Not her business. But one way or another, Goldie was gonna get paid tonight.",
