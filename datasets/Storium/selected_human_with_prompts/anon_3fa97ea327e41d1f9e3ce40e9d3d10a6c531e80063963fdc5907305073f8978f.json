        "comment": "**Central Camp** **Hour 15 (mid-afternoon)** The expedition to Val'Raz, prepared with great care and expense by the combined efforts of the University and the Crown of Shalben, had thus far proceeded relatively smoothly. Of course, archaeology was never tidy, academia was never uncontentious, and nothing that involved so many people happened without *some* tears and headaches. But all things considered, it had gone well; the head of logistics had only threatened to resign twice. Then the disappearances had started. To begin with, it was no more than anyone might expect; the number of people on any dig who fled back to town on discovering how much _work_ archaeology involved was frequently staggering. The fog of suspicion and rumour was unsurprising, too, as the trenches uncovered secrets from a time of legend, and even scholars could have too much imagination. At some point, though, everyone had to accept that there might be more to it than fanciful tales from bored students or twitchy porters. That came when a grizzled veteran of the Tahellan Warmasters Guild limped into camp, barely upright, gasping and bleeding. Demons! Bael Sivornin had spent twenty years fighting beasts and men across the realms. He was no wet behind the ears greenhorn who might mistake a jungle creature for a fiend. If he said that there were demons, the expedition leaders would have to consider the idea. --- Twenty minutes later, the scene in the central camp was less a meeting than a cacophony. \"Well, no one _knows_ how Val'Raz fell \"But _demons_, really, how fanciful. Bandits, now that I could believe...\" An arcanist who went by the name of Ash grimaced to hear the talk. His long forked tail lashed out, disturbing several of his rivals' papers. Rumour said that his mother's mother was a demon from the Infernal Planes, so it was no wonder that he didn't like this line of talk. \"Typical, isn't it? The minute you can't explain something, it must have been _demons_.\" Everyone, please, this isnt helping. No one paid any attention to the efforts of the senior mage-scholar to bring the meeting to order until the Martial Commander slammed her blue steel-edged shield into the floor. Quiet! Irian Shildrath had the fierce nature and commanding presence common to clerics of the forge-god Sil Marne. She spoke, and suddenly everyone was quiet and respectful, glaring at their neighbours as if _other people_ had been causing the trouble, not them. Thank you, Lady Shildrath. She nodded, and took a step back, leaving the floor to the chief archaeologist, Najib Akhiran, who looked as if he would rather be anywhere else. The most important thing is to figure out what has happened. A few people seemed inclined to start whispering again, but a glare from Irian changed their minds. Bael is unconscious, so we cant question him now, and we cant afford to wait for him to wake up. He came from the Eastern Excavation, so I plan to send a party there to investigate. Najib looked around the room, but almost everyone avoided his eyes. More in hope than in expectation, he asked: Does anybody want to volunteer?",

Uniformed security staff directed passengers down the corridors towards the heart of the ship, keeping the steady influx from turning into a crush. \"Greetings, est \"The 0920 shuttle from Cocoa Beach is now disembarking. Please follow the instructions of our security and hospitality staff as you board the *Symphonia*. Thank you.\" Only the stragglers remained from the 0905 Cayenne shuttle, and the new arrivals had been stopped for the final security screening before boarding. A dark-haired white woman, her age probably somewhere around forty, stood watching the proceedings in quiet approval. She was trying to project an air of military competence, but her attitude and bearing told a different story; to those who knew what to look for she was all too obviously ex-police. Her eyes followed one passenger in particular, but she made no move to intercept him. \"Greetings, esteemed guest.\" Passengers continued to flow onto the ship, and the first of the Cocoa Beach arrivals reached the gate. The security staff shepherded them into the correct sectors and, as they walked, their devices downloaded information about the gala reception in a few hours. Until then, they were at liberty to do as they pleased. --- Two corridors converged and flowed forwards as one, the closely-spaced doors on either side marking it as an accommodation area. Nearest the corner were two single cabins, smaller but more private. One of the doors was open just enough to show a flash of green within. The usher, a petite and androgynous person in a crisp new uniform, stepped forward to show the ticket holder down the hall to the indicated cabin. They demonstrated the biometric entry systemas if anyone on Earth might *not* know how one workedand swung the door open to reveal the room beyond. It was somehow exactly as described in the recruitment literature yet also vaguely disappointing. Even a \"virtual tour\" could tell a lie, apparently. \"If you need anything while you're settling in, come and find me. I'll be in the corridor.\" The door closed behind them, leaving the passenger alone. It was the *size*, really. The carefully crafted words and well-chosen camera angles had somehow, probably deliberately, managed to conceal that. Another bed, as yet empty and unclaimed, stood as a reminder that a *second* person would be sharing this too-tight space. At least there was no noise from down the hall. Whether that was due to clever soundproofing or simply an absence of other guests remained to be seen, but it was promising. Still, it hardly mattered. They were aboard the ship now. Their adventure had begun. --- *More challenges will be added as the scene progresses.

        "comment": "**_The Daggers Drawn_** **Trade Station Heraklion** At some point in the not-too-distant past, the Pelagius System had been beautifully unspoilt, as most places unfit for human habitation tended to be. Perhaps it had been a cold, indifferent, lifeless beauty, the kind that only an astronomer could truly appreciate, but even so, it was long gone now. It had started with the discovery of rare minerals in the asteroid fields, intensified as the mining of gas giants swung back into vogue, and now the ruin was complete. Pelagius was littered with makeshift tin-can orbital stations, barely equipped to handle mining, commerce, science, and all of the necessities of modern life. Of these floating bases or 'outposts', the largest and most prominent was Heraklion. When interstellar freighters made it to Pelagius, most of them docked here, so it was the best place to go if you had something to sell, or needed anything the system couldn't provide. It also housed _The Daggers Drawn_, the best-known merc bar in Pelagius. If you needed to hire someone who at least probably wasn't a pirate, there was nowhere better. There was nothing so crude as a \"job board\"; fixers and agents set up meetings in a discreet location, and sometimes friends ran into one another and exchanged details. Couriers, smugglers, salvage crews, even a few bounty-hunters: all could be found here if you knew who to ask. If you believed what _he_ had to say, Garim Larius knew everyone of importance in the whole system. He preferred to employ people who'd worked for him before, which had inspired \"that damn wrench jockey Malinowski\" to ask how anyone got a _first_ chance. Larius had glowered at her, but as luck would have it, he'd had a \"little job\" on his books just then... The rest, as a biographer might say, was history. He wasn't their most regular _or_ their most lucrative employer, but if he had something for them, it was usually worth a look. \"It ain't much of a job.\" They recognised this opening gambit for what it was: an attempt to keep the price down. If he didn't need them to do this, he wouldn't have asked. No one paid for nothing out here. \"Let us be the judge of that.\" \"That's probably best, yeah.\" Larius shot a sideways glance at his only companion, a quietly menacing woman he called Rigger. Whether it was her name, a nickname, a title, or just one of Larius's jokes, no one knew for sure. Nor was it clear what her position was; some claimed she was a simple bodyguard, others that she was the brains of the operation. The truth probably lay somewhere between the two, but wild speculation was more fun. As was her habit, she didn't say anything in reply; very few of Larius's business associates ever heard her speak. But she _did_ raise her eyes eloquently to the ceiling as he turned away. \"Alright, so, it's a salvage job, as I'm sure you could've worked out without me saying it. There's a cargoor part of a cargo, anywayspread across the Rivera Belt, a few hours from here as you head towards Shackleton. I got a client who wants it back, but either they can't be assed to get it, or they'd have to fill too many forms to do it the legit way.\" This was far from uncommon; besides the reasons Larius had offered, there was also a lot less chance of any higher-ups finding out what had happened if you hired mercenaries. \"So it's just a standard tractor beam job. Got any questions?\"",

And, whatever the truth of this proverb in general, it was surely in the minds of the people of Ain-Qisam that evening, when they saw the motley collection of outsiders stumble into their little town. Judging from appearances, these strange folk were adventurers, which in the desert usually meant treasure hunters. Or perhaps grave robbers--though to the Ishkarim this was less an act of desecration and more an inevitable fact of life. Camels spat, sand stung your eyes, jackals looted tombs. In these more enlightened days they burned their dead anyway. So no one in Ain-Qisam paid much attention to the visitors, save to note that some were foreigners while others were not. The large golem that travelled with them raised a few eyebrowsbut, after all, the art of golemancy was not unknown or even very obscure. According to some of the better-educated townsfolk, it was a particularly impressive specimen, but even that was not sufficient to distract them from their own concerns. Their indifference did not last for long, however, once they had learned *why* this particular band of treasure hunters had come to their town. Fevered conversation gripped the marketplace as the locals packed away their wares: \"The Lost City? Are you deaf or are they insane?\" \"My ears are as good as ever they were, thank you. But yes, they seek the Lost City.\" A shrug, careless and dismissive. \"It is not the first time. It will not be the last. People will seek after anything that is lost.\" \"How else are things to be found?\" This from Jinan, the town's lone Priest of Naukar, whose opinion on such things was both predictable and hopelessly biased. \"The Lost City is lost by the will of the gods. Why do these fools believe they can find it?\" \"The will of the gods?\" A snort. \"No; it was *men* who decreed the city should be lost. Though I will not say that they were wrong, for it was a place of wickedness and greed.\" \"Did you see? The man is one of *them*. Who knows what *they* might seek there?\" \"The treasures of his ancestors?\" The speaker let out a hoarse guffaw. \"Don't be a fool.\" Some more pragmatic soul spoke next. \"They have a map, I believe.\" \"A map!\" This was greeted with some scorn. \"Anyone could draw such a thing, to profit from ignorant foreigners. *I* could have done so.\" \"And have done in the past, I would imagine.\" This speaker was a young woman, clad in light chainmail, a shamshir at her belt. \"Well. Perhaps they know the true path. Perhaps not. If you will excuse me, *sudiqan*, I would see these travellers and their map for myself.\" --- In the meantime, the subjects of this conversation had settled in the public room of Ain-Qisam's caravanserai. Refreshments had been ordered, and they were now sampling the local delicacies, including what passed for beer in this part of the world. It was a strange brew, thick and sweet, almost a gruel in its unfiltered state--but for all that it was not unpleasant, and even those who were unfamiliar with it seemed to like it well enough. (Atru, of course, could not drink it at all, though perhaps he wished he could.) In any case, they each had more important things with which to occupy their minds; food and drink ranked a poor second to the task ahead of them. Ain-Qisam was the last marker on their map that could be called at all civilised. When they left on the morrow, they were to strike south and east across untracked lands, at the mercy of the merciless desert.",

        "comment": "How long would it take you to notice that your only child had gone missing? It took Aryn Sunderling fifteen hours. His daughter, Lydia - bright, brash and just seventeen - was given to wandering the countryside at all hours of the day, so when she failed to show up for the morning meal, he thought nothing of it. He was a busy man with students to oversee, and had little energy to expend on worrying about what small mischiefs Lydia might have managed to get into. The girl could handle herself. She *was* his daughter, after all. Then the midday meal came and went, with Lydia still nowhere to be found - and that was when Aryn began to worry. When he went to look in her bedroom - something that, without such a cause, he would never have ventured to do - he found a long, silly letter detailing his daughter's plans to search for a legendary weapon. Her plans to become a great hero. Her plans to get herself embroiled in the war that was possibly brewing between Atalera and Vidaris, miles to the south. And *that* was when Aryn sent out a call for professional help. There were always adventurers passing through Eastholt. It was a well-supplied minor trading post that provided a good deal of goods and services interesting to those of an itinerant persuasion - and for those who fancied themselves as warriors, there was Aryn's school. Many of the local adventuring fighters had trained there at some point or other, and it was generally considered good form to offer to spar the current students when passing through. And so, when Aryn Sanderling put out a call for adventurers, it took hardly any time at all for five likely candidates to be gathered in front of him. The weapons master looked at the composition of the little group, and wisely threw out any parts of his planned speech that centred around the flightiness of young women. \"Thank you for turning out at such short notice,\" he said, as he paced before them. \"I assume you have already heard the reason for my call - but in case you have not, my daughter Lydia has run away. She left a letter behind, in which she outlines her intention to find a weapon of legend and end the potential war with Vidaris before it can start.\" He shook his head. \"Which would be worrying enough, even had I not found a copy of this book under her pillow.\" He handed the book to the nearest adventurer, who took a look at the title page, blanched and passed it on. As far as potentially harmful fantasy masquerading as history went, it was hard to do better - or worse - than *Sword of Destiny: The Truth Behind the Legend of the Sword of Souls*. And it was hard to think of a worse legendary weapon for a naive young person to seek in innocence. \"You will no doubt understand why I put out such an urgent call.\" Aryn said, his voice dry, his face pained. Of course they did. How could they not? \"Warden only knows how she set hands on that book, but at least it tells us what she is seeking and where she will be going.\" He grimaced. \"The *fiction* between these covers espouses the popular opinion that the Sword was lost in the Birchmere when the invader Riach was slain and his armies driven back to Vidaris. So that is where she would go, at least at first.\" It would be a long journey, especially on foot. They could hope to catch Lydia on the road long before then - but the girl had been gone for hours now. Their best hope might be to travel with all haste to Barrowdene, forty miles and more to the south, and hope to pick up news there. \"One more thing,\" Aryn said, his eyes as hard and cold as flints. \"One of the Eastholt Guard saw her leave, but was... *persuaded* not to report it. He is presently in the stocks.\" Barely-restrained violent anger tightened the weapons master's face, reminding all present that, middle-aged or not, there were still few who could best Aryn Sunderling in a fight. \"I don't know what good questioning him might do you, but perhaps you wish to throw something at him before you leave.\" Suddenly his faced softened, and in a much more gentle voice - the voice of a worry-stricken father - he said, \"I... there is no way for me to thank you enough for what you are doing for me - and for Lydia. This is a truly noble thing that you do. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.\"",
