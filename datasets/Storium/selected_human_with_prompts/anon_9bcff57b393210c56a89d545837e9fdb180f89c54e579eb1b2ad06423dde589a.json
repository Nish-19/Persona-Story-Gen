The sky is clear, the moon waxing, the stars twinkling in quiet assent to its passage. A small building is on the island. Concrete walls and the silhouette of a radar dish on the top. Inside the building sits a figure. Impossible to make out features in the dim light of the barely- half moon, but medium height, medium build. Unremarkable. Before him- perhaps 'him', anyway- sits a small terminal, the kind of chunky, monochrome display that was common in the late 1980s. Data scrolls across it, not too fast to read, but fast enough that he needs to focus. Finally, there is a sharp intake of breath, followed by a resigned sigh. He reaches into a black leather briefcase at his feet and retrieves a phone, then pulls a slender metal antennae from the top. He doesn't dial a number, just lifts the phone to his ear. \"Seventeen over six. Yes, the usual restrictions.\" No further conversation, no pleasantries, he just hangs up. And then there is a quiet shudder across the island... AUGUST 17 (Now, or near enough) Sand, thought Arlo Mason, had never tasted so good. You'd think that after three weeks of fresh tropical fruit, rare steaks, and enough fruity tropical cocktails to sink the navy, that sand would be an unwelcome surprise, but then again, swimming 50 meters across murky tropical waters changes one's standards. All told, Arlo figured he could have had it worse. He'd at least made it out with his favourite Acapulco shirt. He was soaked through, but the sun was drying everything fast. In fact, Arlo was half-considering lying down and working on his tan. The beach was beautiful- one of those little white sand, rock wall grotto places that seem to only exist in travel brochures and... well, in his screenplays. This would be great reference material for his next movie. But, his better nature kicked in, and no sooner had he dragged himself ashore than he was charging back into the surf to haul in the rest of the survivors. He recognized some faces- Miranda Weeks, the captain of the Xerxes, the towering cruise liner that would never sail again; Nils Klytor, the weird old German who never came out of his cabin; Bria Giles, the head of security- and a few other faces as well. But the familiar faces were few and far between as a sea of people poured out of the cracks in the Xerxes' hull and made their way towards the island. As surf splashed around Arlo's feet and the shouts of the survivors rang in his ears, the cool head and quick wit that made him famous faltered for just a moment, and Arlo realized that he was, in fact, in a great deal of trouble. And as more and more bodies dragged themselves, gasping onto the shore, others watched from not so far away- and could not help but agree with Arlo's assessment.",

Nothing awry, except that you looked in the mirror that morning and saw something that wasn't your face looking back. \n\nTom Garland is doing a book signing not far from where you live, in a little town called DeWitt.

        "comment": "Thomas Garland is alone in a room. The lights are off. Yet there is just barely enough light by which he can see, a faint blue glow. He's sitting on a couch, the upholstery frayed, colour faded from black to gray. In front of him is an Ottoman, faux-leather with scratches and tears from years of hard use. On the Ottoman is a small box, dark wood, lacquered with something exquisitely slick. Plain, little more than a cube with a few small spheres for feet. The blue glow comes from a barely visible crack around the top of the box. Thomas Garland is looking at the box, eyes never moving from it. The only other object on the Ottoman is an old cellular phone, the kind that flips. This is Thomas Garland's house, and it is not Thomas Garland's house. This is Thomas Garland. And he is not Thomas Garland. Thomas Garland knows what will be inside the box when he opens it. And he knows what will happen when he opens the box. Worse, he thinks to himself, is that he knows what will happen if he doesn't. For a heartbeat's length there is a figure standing before him, all pale skin and dead, rolling eyes. Thomas Garland blinks, and it is gone. This is Thomas Garland. And Thomas Garland opens the box. --- DeWitt, Midwest United States. DeWitt is an oddity of a town. Small enough that most of the locals know each other, big enough that someone who knows what they're doing can hide. Modern conveniences but a kind of late 70s aesthetic. Just off a few major highways but still not really on the way to anywhere. Nice place. Nice people. It's the kind of place Enzo Ciaretti hates. Enzo Ciaretti is from New York, and frankly, any place with a population density lower than Times Square wigs him out. A childhood among the skyscrapers and smokestacks of midtown New York have given him a touch of agoraphobia, and he can feel the sweat beading on his forehead as he looks out at the unoccupied street ahead of him. It doesn't help that today hasn't been off to a great start. Garland isn't answering his phone, and the seminar is due to begin in less than three hours. Greg went to fish Tom out of his place and drag him over, only Greg hasn't come back yet. And Greg isn't picking up his phone either. To be blunt, Enzo is starting to get nervous. He does his best to swallow it- Greg has handled this sort of situation before, he knows what he's doing. All Enzo has to do is keep people out of the auditorium until an hour before the performance, and check tickets as they come in. He nods, folds his hands behind his back, and takes a long, deep breath. --- This brings us to the five travellers, just checking into their rooms at the Cygnus Hotel in DeWitt. Bags are left on the coarse carpet, beds are tested in the customary ways following a long day of travel. Plastic is removed from bars of hotel soap, complimentary mints are eaten. Each realizes that from their hotel room, they can see the auditorium where Garland's seminar is to take place in a little less than three hours. Then, the phone rings. Each of the five responds in their own way, but each realizes that the headaches, the nosebleeds, the inexplicable pain that accompanies **those** calls is absent, so, slowly, each picks up the phone. Static fuzzes the line, but the words are clear enough. \"This is a wake-up call, Patient Dawn. It's a sharp-edged universe and you've caught your sleeve on it. I won't pretend I can help you, but help can't be found by looking. Head to the auditorium, find Del Salazar. He's inside.\" The line clicks dead. Each of the five looks out their window at the auditorium- it's still early, so there's no line, but they probably aren't letting people in this early. But if this 'Del Salazar' can help, it just might be worth it to find a way in...",

        "comment": "*Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep* *In the affliction of these terrible dreams* *That shake us nightly.* - William Shakespeare, *Macbeth* **Chapter One: These Terrible Dreams** The bent antenna hangs above the fort like a gallows. The drone that clipped it lies in a smouldering ruin a kilometre out. The Envan corpses littering the three clicks around the fort are by now only skeletons, the Envan survivors having stripped the flesh away as they retreated, storing it for later to reconstitute it around better, stronger, worthier bones. It has been three days since the dropships left. It has been two since the three survivors of the battle realized there would be no escape. It has been one since the girl wandered out of the desert, all ashen skin and loud, hacking cough, confirming what the Amalgam scientists had been saying for two years- Belfathan was Lost. They let her into the fort, of course, it couldn't do any harm. The Loss wasn't a thing you caught from someone else, and the Lost were still human, right up until they weren't anymore, so just as well she spend her time with someone. They'd taken her in and told her about the Loss, about the creeping grey fog that started claiming worlds five years ago, about the sickness that preceded its coming. They told her that the timing varies but that it inevitably ends in death. By silent, mutual agreement, they did not tell her what happens afterwards. They did not tell her about Enoch VI, and the towers of blackened flesh, the streets that wailed underfoot. They did not tell her about Udaroth and the acres upon acres of jungle that whispered your secrets back at you as you passed. They did not tell her about the giant, stone heads on High Vesper, and the blank, empty stares of the people who lived in their shadows. They did not tell her what was left when the fog receded. But they did tell her that there were stories of people who had somehow beaten the Loss- Duncan was the first to bring them up, but Tarn nodded his assent and even the laconic, acerbic Adhemar eventually agreed that he'd heard stories. Of course, none of them knew how it could be done. It has been half a day since the generators failed. It has been half an hour since the decision was made to leave. It was, they all agreed, the only choice. The LIDAR Arrays had stopped receiving the signatures of the Amalgam battleships almost as soon as the last dropship had vanished from view. There was no way off the planet from the fort, but even in the burned out husks of cities left by the Envan advance, there may yet be something intact enough to haul them into orbit, and from there, back to Amalgam space. Maybe. The only sensible destination is Vinath, a city a couple hours drive away. The city had a spaceport, one of the biggest on Belfathan- no telling if it's still intact, but it's a place to start. Someone needs to assess the state of the vehicles. There are two still parked near the fort. One, an APC, hunches like a beetle, all rugged metal and hard angles. The other is Tarn's DRAGON-5 skip-skiff- he hasn't had a chance to assess its state since the battle. Most of the fort is in bad shape, there's no reason to believe the vehicles will be any different. That being said, without one, they won't get far. There's also the matter of supplies- most of the fort has been picked clean, but there's enough time to go over it again. They've agreed to take one hour to get prepared, and though they've packed up all the food they can carry and even a couple of weapons, someone with good eyes may yet find something of value. It's time to load up- you have one hour. If there's to be any hope of escape, you will have to leave soon. For the Loss travels fast once its heralds arrive, and there's no telling what horrors it will leave in its wake on Belfathan. ----------------- ADHEMAR'S Status is: NORMAL DUNCAN'S Status is: NORMAL MALLORY'S Status is: LOST TARN'S Status is: NORMAL",

        "comment": "Candlecourt, United Kingdom. It's a quiet day- a Sunday. There aren't many people out, the streets are mostly empty. Mostly empty, save for one man standing on a street corner. He's wearing a business suit- impeccably tailored- with a bright purple shirt beneath it, the top few buttons undone to show that he's a professional who knows how to party. He's tapping his foot in time to the beat of music that's pumping in through his earphones. He's wearing a Walkman. One of the old ones. For cassettes. He's really getting into the beat of the music when someone else approaches. They could be brothers, they look so alike- they're even dressed the same. Only the shirt is different- the newcomer's is a deep red, almost burgundy. \"Dima,\" the red-shirted man says. \"Arkady\", Dima replies. \"Have you heard this tape? It's really good.\" \"I guarantee I've heard it already.\" \"You will at some point, I suppose.\" \"That's what I said.\" Their voices are completely neutral- almost interchangeable. They could be from anywhere in North America- but there's a vague accent that could be Eastern European, if you listened very hard. \"You've been busy, Dima.\" \"I'm always busy, Arkady.\" \"Of course. You do understand this won't work, though?\" \"On the contrary, Arkady, not only will it work, it will prove what I've been saying for years.\" \"Dima, Dima. Would you wager your reputation on that?\" \"I already have, but if you're asking for a wager-\" \"I am.\" \"Then I accept. Nineteen over eight, the usual restrictions.\" \"Please. Make it worth my while, I did not come here for my health. Sixteen over six, Valentich restrictions.\" \"Eighteen over five, Isdal restrictions, and I'll even waive the optionals.\" \"Then I accept. Eighteen over five, Isdal restrictions, optionals waived. When shall we begin?\" \"But we already have.\" \"Or will soon, in any case.\" --- The five of them entered the hotel at around the same time. They didn't plan it that way, it just happened. Three of them were here because they needed a place to stay. They'd been seeing the messages for years now- in billboards, in movies, in books and in internet chatrooms. Each of them, in their own way, had reached the breaking point. For Luna, it had come when she'd opened a book to find a short haiku scrawled inside in an unfamiliar hand: \"Arkady, my friend, Come to Candlecourt post haste, And please bring some snacks\" For Alayne, it had come after years of hearing those two- Arkady and Dima- appear on her damn tapes. It didn't matter what she was doing, or whose audio she had in the booth that day, Arkady and Dima always seemed to make an appearance. Finally they mentioned Candlecourt, and she figured this was her chance to figure out why they kept screwing up her work. And for Tague, it had come when he'd gone to pay his tab and had seen a message from Arkady printed on the receipt. As for Ben and Eddie, well. They'd been living in Candlecourt for some time, where bizarre occurrences were paradoxically routine. Candlecourt had always been a hotspot for paranormal activity. UFO sightings, ghost stories, and legends of monsters in the woods had all abounded for the last few decades, and rare was the summer where they didn't get a slew of tourists eager for some legend tripping. So, when Eddie had opened a library book to find a message from Arkady asking Dima to meet him at the Lion's Mane at 3:00, and Ben had likewise found a message from Dima saying that he wouldn't be able to do it until 4:00 since his stomach was acting up, they saw this for what it was- an opportunity. They all entered the inn to find a man with wild hair and wilder eyes leaning over the counter at the proprietor. \"You don't *get* it, Lucas! They said they'd be here, today, at four o'clock!\" The man swings his arms around with blatant disregard for the antiquities on display in the Lion's Mane Inn's foyer. \"Calm down, Alec, please. Really. Did they say they'd bring the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny with them?\" \"This isn't a game, Lucas! Haven't you been following the messages?! The numbers are changing!\" \"Mm-hm. Are they getting bigger, or smaller this time?\" Alec nods, seeming to have found his opening. \"I thought there was a downward trend, but it looks like they're ticking up again. Look-\" He reaches into his pocket and spreads a slew of newspaper clippings onto the table. \"Last week, it was twenty three over nine, then sixteen over nine. Then it drops way down to five over three, but just today, look-\" He thumps a finger on the table. \"Twenty *six* over nine.\" He folds his arms and smiles. \"Twenty six.\" Lucas whistles, long and low. \"Well, it sounds like things are well in hand, then.\" \"What? No!\" He waves his hands over the paper. \"It's-\" \"Alex, please-\" Lucas gestures past him, towards the five who just entered. \"I have guests. Can we do this later?\"",

        "comment": "*In this dark world where he now dwelt, ugly things and surprising things and once in a long while a tiny wondrous thing spilled out at him constantly; he could count on nothing.* - Phillip K. Dick, *A Scanner Darkly* **Chapter 1: Ugly Things and Surprising Things** Watching a supertanker come in is always an incongruous sight, like a whale doing ballet. This behemoth, so ponderous and lumbering, so seemingly unable to do anything more complicated than flying straight ahead very fast, slowly turns and twists itself into exactly the right position for the docking clamps to slam down and pull it tightly into the loving embrace of Hephaestus Station. A complicated interplay of computers, cogitator arrays, RCS thrusters, and impossibly skilled pilots brought together two of the biggest objects in the Novik system in perfect union. Thats not true, actually, there were bigger objects than the *Callous Fox* in the system. The Anthem corporation had recently fielded several 7th-generation Legacy battleships, among them the impossibly vast ALV *Honoured Citadel*. But Hephaestus Station still dwarfed them all, still sat hovering over Rajaneimi like a carrion bird circling a carcass. It had not been so long ago that Rajaneimi had been the crown jewel of the Novik sector, a world so rich in mineral and chemical deposits that any sufficiently large company could drop a factorum from orbit, circle the system, and return to find a thriving mining empire. But resources deplete the same as everything else, and almost before anyone knew it, Rajaneimi was emptied out, and Hephaestus Station, formerly the home of the wealthy and powerful of the empires below, became a haven for the downtrodden, the scum, and the helpless. Somehow, though, the place never lost its sheen: it had always been the home of opportunity, but where once it had been the home of the elite, it was now a place where anyone could make their way from the bottom to the top, provided they had a casual enough attitude towards what most races called scruples. And somehow the place was all the more fantastic for that. Where once had been stodgy executives- predominantly old, human men in clean, sharp suits- there were now people of every race, species and stripe walking the catwalks and strips of Hephaestus, working its docks, hawking their wares in the market, and murdering one another in the outer levels. It had always been about freedom. But where once reigned the freedom of the rich to get richer, now Hephaestus catered to a broader range of freedoms. It was dangerous, and it was never easy, but if you could make it here- as the saying goes- you could make it anywhere. The docking bay was full of the usual suspects. As is so often the case with types like these, nobody was standing close enough to each other that they could be seen as being associated with one another. There on the catwalk is Spaulding. Spaulding is one of those people who seems to materialize out of the woodwork wherever there's money to be made, the one whom everyone knows, nobody likes, but who nonetheless maintains a significant presence in the underworld. He's scooping out the last of an avocado from its skin- that was the other odd thing about Spaulding, he seemed to have a talent for finding those items that were not contraband, but that would cost you an arm and a leg to get transported in. Fresh fruit, eggs, real coffee and tea (not the pre-ground or bagged stuff), pipe tobacco- it wasn't at all unusual to see Spaulding waltzing down the Main Drag, just polishing off a plump chicken leg or smoking an honest-to-god joint. Nobody knew how he did it, but everybody knew that he did, and he made sure of it. It wasn't even necessarily that the products would spoil. A-drives had more or less dealt with the problem of long spaceflight ('A' for 'Alcubierre' or for 'Anthem Corporation'- take your pick). It was just that they were expensive, prohibitively so, and when the credit chits come in and you have your choice of a nice plate of eggs and bacon, rent for your ResPod, or bribing someone to look the other way while you do something untoward with a lead pipe, most people will just grab whatever soy-based goop is coming out of the caf-tubes and call it a day. Suffice it to say, there were people who would happily kill their own grandmother to know how Spaulding managed it. Also in evidence is Jody Whidby, the supervisor at Dock A. Jody was that rare phenomenon on Hephaestus Station, namely, a genuinely good soul. A person who had been desperate for off-world work and had taken the only job available, and who now was simply trying to make the best of an unenviable situation. Jody's good nature was, regrettably, the thing holding her back the most, she had the steely resolve and no-nonsense attitude that makes someone valuable in any number of unsavoury lines of work, but lacked the cutthroat attitude that really made someone an upwardly mobile crook. She couldn't be bribed and she couldn't be threatened, but she was valuable to every smuggler on the station in another way- she was a known quantity. When dealing with Jody Whidby, you knew exactly where you stood. You knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was playing precisely by the rules. Jody Whidby was the kind of person you could plan around. And that's just scratching the surface of the scum around Dock A on Supertanker Day. There's the guy who's just a bit too big for his jacket, hand nervously hovering near the telltale bulge of a weapon under his shoulder. There's the hollow-eyed dockworker who's just there to pick up the paycheck and get home. There's the man with the cold stare and the academy badge who's harder to read than the fine print on a lawyer's contract. And there's the suit, the suit that's just a little too clean, a little too sharp, to be skulking around the docks, which makes you wonder what the story is behind the guy who's wearing it. These are the people of Hephaestus Station, and these are their stories.",
