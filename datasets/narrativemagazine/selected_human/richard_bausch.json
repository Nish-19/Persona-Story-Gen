        "comment": "These days, after work, he visits the Museum of the Americas. He wanders in the South American wing and looks at the figures amid artifacts in the glassed-in cases. Time collapses. Cort\u00e9s is a few miles away; he has been with those who pushed back the Toltecs, Zapotecs, Mayans. There is no wristwatch on his arm, and he tells time by the use of twenty tons of stone. In a display case under glass are bones, the blade of a knife. He can believe that his people live on floating islands and that they farm corn, beans, peppers, tobacco. The air is clearer. He has a dark, young wife. His days are peaceful, and he knows what is expected. He\u2019s taller, younger, stronger. Meaner. He has no children. He\u2019s bronze colored from the sun, and he can see the polished walls of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in the distance. No one has ever heard of a car. The clatter of the world, its weather and war and machinery\u2014that\u2019s all somewhere far off. He doesn\u2019t hear the noise of it anymore.\n\nDo you know where you are now?\n\nWilliam P. Howell. Divorced. Forty-eight. Wife living with someone else. Pregnant with his child. One afternoon I start over there, planning what I\u2019ll say. Filled with rage. Do not know Alphonse Blum, a boy running after a ball, afraid of his father, who is too strict. An imaginative boy worried about his pancreas, at nine years old. This bright child with the skinny legs and dark skin. I can now see him lying awake at night imagining himself a superhero.\n\nThis is good. Go on.\n\nWilliam P. Howell. Never hurt a soul.\n\nHere. Wipe your eyes. Talk about yourself some; it\u2019s all right, and it\u2019s true.\n\nIf William P. Howell had a son, the son would also be dark. A boy with hair that shines, down to his shoulders. He would be strong and fast.\n\nGo on. Keep telling. You never hurt a soul. And remember, you intended no harm.\n\nIn his part of the city, the streets are crowded with others. Each life gathers and glides past him. He thinks of the great dedication of the pyramid temple in Tenochtitl\u00e1n: the sacrifice of twenty thousand lives.\n\nWhen you can speak. You know . . .\n\nHe has the museum. He walks in every day and waits for the faint but bearable condolence of the settling dust. It doesn\u2019t matter what else there has been in a day\u2014work, the so-called healing process, the kindness of others (priests, friends, professional listeners like you, the parents of the boy), the weight of his grief, the food he swallows, the blur of seeing all day, the work of his hands, the music coming out of the walls where he works. He craves the museum.\n\nYou had a moment\u2019s inattention. It could happen to any of us. A lapse. A man driving home at sundown from work. It\u2019s been months. And it wasn\u2019t your fault. The police report says he ran out between two cars.\n\nDoctors, counselors, the difficult forgiveness of two young people who can\u2019t bring themselves to mean it, friends, women and men whose faces change when he comes near. No one knows quite how to put it away.\n\nOthers have told him what they can tell him. Not good living alone. He has friends who watch him closely now, and worry. He loves them. He can\u2019t stand the thought of losing anyone at all. He doesn\u2019t drive anymore. But in the Museum of the Americas, among the yellow pieces of temple wall and the shards of pottery and the depictions of Chapultepec, the anguish begins to change at last, begins to shift, like a slow lengthening of light.\n\nWhen he was an American on a normal day, with half the world hungry and the wars on the far continent, he did not feel the weight of the sky. The tonnage of the present. He can\u2019t support it now. He hears the clatter of the bones slamming against metal. He sees the instruments of emergency and procedure; he looks at the whitened faces of the others and sees blood on the little finger of the boy\u2019s small dark left hand, and then the door closes. He sees it and he sees it and he sees it and he sees it.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more to say, is there?\n\nWilliam P. Howell. My God.\n\nDo you want some time?\n\nIn the Museum of the Americas, there are stories of slaughter fixed and gone in time. The country was taken inch by inch in blood. It\u2019s all there, the guilty centuries.\n\nDo you want me to leave you alone?\n\nPlease. He\u2019ll make his own way out, head down, into the chaos and terror of the street.\n\n",
