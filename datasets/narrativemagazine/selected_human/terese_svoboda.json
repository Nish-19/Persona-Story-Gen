        "comment": "Five of us boys come up thirsty. Maybe it\u2019s the Jap dark, the way it settles into the countryside, creeps along through the rickrack trees and all the snow until we are just barely swallowing. Or it\u2019s the thirst we have from looking at the walls of the barracks and thinking maybe we are the ones who gave up and got caught. But no\u2014if we can thirst, we can act on it. Not that we ourselves have done much in the action department, no, we are strictly mop-up.\n\nGates\u2014he\u2019s at least fifteen\u2014the hooch is his idea. You can sign out and chew down the sulfa prophylactics they give you even when you are just going off to church, you can walk into town and hope for Parcheesi with your glass of sissy fizz\u2014or you can pay top Jap dollar for a farmer to dig up a stone jar full of pepper juice, a fuel you have never thought to actually drink in your life, Gates tells us\u2014and that farmer, we have heard, can only be roused at the end of this shortcut Gates has heard about.\n\nI don\u2019t like Gates as a rule. He doesn\u2019t like me. As MPs we get more opportunity to express ourselves in these matters and we have, he and I, so I am all for any other plan, except Wheezer, a blond dooser of a lumberjack who I know a little from basic, has drunk this farmer\u2019s homemade wine and makes a sound so happy about it, I fall in.\n\nSnow in the dark is a good thing though the moon too would\u2019ve been a help. After we circle this barracks\u2019 wall that has taken us a month to nail up it is that big around, Gates finds the beaten-down path he is talking about even in all this snow and we follow him, single file.\n\nGates talks a mile a minute, the way you would in a place like this, all done up with tombs and look-alike Buddha statues and stick markers. We follow mostly his voice. A regular tour guide, he is telling us why they like to put this up when all they do is cremate. I don\u2019t know how Gates knows anything about anything, he is too young even to be drinking let alone educating us all about it, but he could\u2019ve been older, which is part of why we don\u2019t get along, his age could be a lie too.\n\nSo what if they believe their ghosts rise up and drink blood\u2014we are the victors.\n\nWheezer knows enough to walk between us, and the other two just trudge along, watching their rears like Gates is right.\n\nWonder how a place like this didn\u2019t get hit, says Gates.\n\nThey\u2019re already dead, I say. The others get the joke but their laughs aren\u2019t much against all their fast left right left.\n\nThe farmer is asleep just as Gates predicts and we have to wake up the whole family plus the farm animals. But no dogs. I guess they ate the dogs a while back, but the doves and a rooster they keep in cages. The wife talks and we nod while the farmer goes off somewhere secret with a shovel, that is to say, Gates and I try to get the liquor for a little less than they want and the wife knows better and makes sure we don\u2019t see where it\u2019s kept. She\u2019s our age, half our size, and with a nice front. We wave clumps of bills an inch thick like we know exactly what\u2019s what but she sticks to her guns and asks for more. How does she know we can\u2019t do the calculations? asks Wheezer. Do we look that dumb? The other two peel off more bills, they don\u2019t care, the whole thing is a show to them.\n\nWe sit down in their sort of bedroom, the kind without a bed, and play cards while we wait.\n\nWhen the farmer turns up, he\u2019s got a grin across his face that his wife lights into. We just hope he hasn\u2019t sampled the jar to the bottom. He lets us into a shed next to his house\u2014a lot of dry leaves draped overhead\u2014and gives us cups to go with the jar that still has straw hanging from it. Gates pushes up his sleeves and goes at it, pouring and pretending to speak the way they do. Pretty soon all five of us are pretty fluent. Gates says let\u2019s get the wife up and you know and Wheezer says we\u2019re all MPs right? But I tell Gates he\u2019s too young to know what to do and he says Bastard under his breath and with the cold this whole cloud of Bastard rises up when he lays his gun on the table.\n\nWe are only allowed guns when we guard prisoners outside the barracks so this is a surprise. But then one of the two guys pulls out another one. I\u2019ll double you, says the guy, like it is a bet. Looking at Wheezer, I guess I\u2019m the only one out of the picture. Gates deals another hand. The revolvers sit in the moonlight between them like two holy things, and I\u2019ve been to church services that weren\u2019t as quiet as this game. We all sip at our drinks and look at our cards.\n\nGates wins, takes the other gun, and relaxes.\n\nI thought the occupation was some kind of job, says Wheezer, dealing again.\n\nA job where you really get under somebody\u2019s skin, says Gates. He is looking through the door the farmer left open into where the woman is lying on her side beside her husband, her eyes watching.\n\nI never think of the Japs as having ghosts, I say.\n\nIt\u2019s no bunch of malarkey to them, says Gates. His cards must not look so good, he doesn\u2019t bet the guns.\n\nI play real slow. You know when we talk, I say, they don\u2019t look at us.\n\nDo you think they could be listening? says one of the other two.\n\nThey could be, says Gates. Their language is pretty tough compared to ours, they could be catching on. He asks for another card.\n\nMaybe they know what we are thinking too, says Wheezer, and folds.\n\nGates takes the pot. Oh, mama-san, he says, and gets up.\n\nIt is Wheezer\u2014not me\u2014who kicks Gates in the groin, kind of by accident. While he\u2019s rolling around swearing like a sonofabitch, reaching for those guns that I stand in front of, mama-san comes in the door in a rush as if she\u2019s concerned, but before anyone can pull her in, she makes it known that someone Big is coming.\n\nWheezer and me and Gates, we take our time. We are MPs after all and nobody but a major can trouble us. I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve made the sign for major if she knew it because Gates gets her by the waist and tries to lick her face.\n\nThen we hear the jeep. Majors do have jeeps.\n\nWheezer and Gates race off along the edge of the cemetery, way ahead of me because I have to take a leak or die and do so despite everything, against what I think is a small tree but turns out to be carved and dead. Not that I am so concerned with the foliage. By the time I put some ground under me and catch up, they are already mired to their waists in an honest-to-god honey wagon.\n\nThis is about the funniest thing. These vats are right level with the ground so as to be convenient for the user but hard to spot for somebody who isn\u2019t savvy to them, especially in all this snow. Gates and Wheezer are coated all over with the slick of it, and Gates is actually sinking further down. I am not about to help him but after I pull out Wheezer, I see Gates really is having a time of it, his eyes are open that wide, so I find one of those bamboo poles and hold it out to him.\n\nSomehow it hits him on the head.\n\nI am crying now, with tears I am laughing so hard. Once he\u2019s on his feet, Wheezer and I throw snowballs at him. At first he pops back a few really hard ones, then he rubs the snow into the shit on his chest like it\u2019s a target. By then someone\u2019s coming and we all pick up our feet through the snow the way those football stars do, in and out of tires, for practice, only this time we go straight through the middle of the cemetery, we dodge all the pagodas and statues and raised cement and once a real fox and of course the big trees everywhere, bare branched or green spiked, shaking and moaning with Gates\u2019s ghosts, all those dead Japs who would like us dead, and since we don\u2019t really know which way is home or where the next honey wagon sits, it takes us a long time, especially with the clouds that keep on covering up that little moon.\n\nThe other two shoot off the guns somewhere in the dark.\n\nEven then we think nobody sees us.\n\n"

        "post_title": "Selling Cigarettes",
        "comment": "I could extend both arms inside my cubicle, if you included the window slot that I delivered the cigarettes through. Candy too but mostly cigarettes bought in some Southern state near the tobacco fields and smuggled over state lines for cheap. Basil didn\u2019t do the smuggling. Balding, bellicose, and most of the time beaming, the closest he came to clandestine was using a paper bag to hold the take, reasoning that carrying a zippered cash purse had dollar signs all over it, and his bag said \u201cLunch.\u201d\n\nI was not eating lunch in those days, too expensive, maybe a Mars bar that I had to report. Lunch also took time away from slapping packs into the hands forever sticking themselves through the slot, something I did almost maternally rather than for money, given that the job paid maybe five bucks an hour. Again and again those hands beseeched, wriggling their impatient, addicted fingers. I worked in Times Square, long before the area was covered with moving images rather than the lurid static. Businessmen, not just the down-and-outs, were customers, men slumming for pleasure, starting with nicotine. It never occurred to me that I was being sold too, standing inside my glass-fronted box. Wearing peasant skirts and long-sleeved tops, without makeup, not even lipstick, I represented less the gateway drug of nicotine than the loss leader, virtue. How could the peep shows be so bad if she was here?\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself as part of what there was to see at all, I saw only the hands coming in through the slot with their clutched cash, sometimes wanting whole cartons, some just matches. Seldom did I have time to exchange any semblance of talk through the glass, what had been touted by Basil as bulletproof\u2014as reassurance, not to scare me\u2014but what was surely only thick Plexiglass, old and scratched. He hired me as soon as he heard I was going to Columbia. He said only girls from the finest institutions (emphasis on the syllable tu) can add. Few can these days, grumbled Basil, grabbing the paper bag with my calculations stapled to its fold.\n\nWhen my shift ended midafternoon\u2014and it often did, since Times Square attracted early risers and late-goers, people who needed cigarettes far more than coffee or the light of day\u2014Basil would take me along in his old station wagon to have me collect the paper bags from other cubicles. Who would imagine a girl could have so much cash? I didn\u2019t know about the Mafia and its stranglehold on his faux importation of tobacco, how Basil must have paid them off or been part of it.\n\nSince it was too much trouble to unlatch the so-called bulletproof window, the girls in the other cubicles stuffed their bags through the slots, girls grateful for the three-minute break of hello-how-are-you, sitting on stools like mine in an equally tiny space, surrounded by merchandise stretching far up to the ceiling and a space heater at their feet that threatened to turn it all into smoke. They were usually caught reading, book in one hand, a packet of cigarettes in the other, Peyton Place more often than Varieties of Religious Experience, resisting the education Basil said we all needed and that he so envied. He wanted women good with spreadsheets, not sheets, he said. I suspected otherwise, he treated us so nicely. A bonus every month of as many candy bars as you wanted, guaranteeing to stop pilfering he said, because of how sick it would make us. No one was hired who smoked, but the stench of tobacco was so strong in our clothes people asked us for a light on the subway home.\n\nI had an interview one afternoon for a new job that its ad said would pay better. Women only, for artistic purposes. It sounded, at the very least, less claustrophobic. Basil was annoyed. All that training he\u2019d given me going to waste on art? I didn\u2019t enumerate the three things I had learned from him: adding on a machine, smiling at the customer but not too much, and always stacking the bills faceup, from small to big.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I have a contract, I said, tossing my half-eaten Mars bar out the car window, having found a delicate white worm in the center.\n\nCurious who would pay more for an untrained girl, he drove me to the interview, the paper bags already collected. It\u2019s the least I can do, he said, trying to sound terribly generous. That way I can return you back to your job with two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nIt\u2019s just an interview, I said, as if his job meant everything.\n\nAre you looking to bargain for a higher wage?\n\nThe thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me, I said. Sure.\n\nHe was pulling up to the location. Well, you might have me over a barrel, he said, seeing money in exclamation marks all in the building. Sleek, of the newest architecture, it even had automatic elevators without a nosy operator, as I soon discovered once inside.\n\nI was ready for art.\n\nRoom 507 contained a man with a clipboard sitting on a folding chair and a camera on a stand. No one else waited to be seen. Hello, said the man, as impersonally as possible. No point in sitting down, he said.\n\nI\u2019ve been selling cigarettes, I said, as if it were a credential.\n\nThat\u2019s nice, he said, and tilted his head to look me over. I pay well, just like it says in the ad.\n\nArt? I asked, the ad out of my purse and in my hand.\n\nCommercial, he said, still eyeing me. Take off your clothes.\n\nDid I say, What? Did I say, Thanks anyway? I took off my clothes. After all, I\u2019d spent a semester drawing nudes. Though I didn\u2019t go so far as to pull my jeans past my knees. Surely he could get enough of an idea without that. I was already braless, and stood with my shirt half-untucked, hanging on my arm.\n\nHe was embarrassed for me. He waved his hand and said he\u2019d call. Put your number here, he said, pointing at his clipboard. He didn\u2019t even take a picture with his big camera.\n\nBasil had circled the block a few times but he was waiting. I got in.\n\nYou could use a drink, he said, glancing at me. There\u2019s a nice ladies\u2019 place uptown. He swung into traffic, away from Times Square.\n\nI don\u2019t drink, I said, and I have schoolwork.\n\nHe kept on driving. You girls are a dime a dozen, he said. It\u2019s amazing. Art, he said, shaking his head.\n\nI hopped out at the first stoplight.\n\n"

        "comment": "Very intellectual, says Polly. The rollers in her hair, a dozen frozen-juice cans, make the satirical bob that follows dragonesque and fierce.\n\nThe paper\u2019s hopeless? I shuffle the pages in order, out of order.\n\nPolly uses an index finger to slide a single sheet out of the stack. The sad part is that it could have been any sheet, a fact Polly soon shares, pointing here and there in critique.\n\nI scramble to note every comment. I forgive her her tone\u2014a self-reflexive slip, really, how she covers her genius with generosity. We work until daylight, until I\u2019m caffeine-shaky at the keys and she\u2019s fixing footnotes. She lies across my bed, her long hair unspooling off the rollers, her fairest-of-them-all skin surrounding \u201cdevouring eyes\u201d\u2014an English-class description\u2014not to mention a set of knockers the covers only half-cover, nightgowns for her being too bourgeois and confining.\n\nI myself am wrapping my shoulders in a ruana, the South American blanket I wear to make my nightgown look like a peasant skirt\u2014that is to say, I\u2019m dressed\u2014when Dad calls.\n\nShe picks up. Mr. Schmeckler? They laugh, my dad just as amused by her pet name for him as she is, he being more Irish than Easter\u2014his phrase. They chat and she doesn\u2019t say a word about how hard she\u2019s worked all night for his errant daughter\u2014her phrase\u2014while I stir the discarded orange-juice cans in search of a paper clip.\n\nThey\u2019re arriving at three, she says in a beat, hanging up.\n\nYou could, like, let me talk too, I say over my toothbrush.\n\nShe casts her eyes up, where Somebody is surely noting my obtuseness. You were busy.\n\nEventually I head out, paper in hand, barefoot against the spring dew, so much dew my ruana, unwrapping, gets soggy. As I\u2019m leaving, Polly says we should get my parents to take us to Bunny\u2019s after graduation. Her prof treated her there last week, and she loved it.\n\nIt\u2019s like electricity, the way she loves and wants you in on it, a straight connection. It\u2019s a girls\u2019 college we\u2019re going to, but guys\u2014maintenance all the way to department heads\u2014know her name, they get the electricity too. With her by my side, I\u2019m not just another Mick on a scholarship. I can\u2019t finish papers for the life of me, but my analysis is great, or so she says.\n\nBut nix to the office drop-off, school\u2019s so over. I run on, ruana flapping, past one cul-de-sac of Americana after another, to my prof\u2019s house.\n\nPolly and I will be Two Broads Abroad again this summer, in England, a fellowship for her and teaching English to Asians for me\u2014don\u2019t ask. Last summer we drank beer in Munich and did her prof\u2019s research. That\u2019s when Dad took on this Schmeckler name. He showed up with flowers for us around August, just when we were running low on the stipend, about six marks short of giving up and flying home. I was surprised. Dad had never shown up before. I mean, he\u2019s never made any graduation of mine or my brother\u2019s, he was always working so hard, but last summer he was riding the \u201960s high on a contract for explosive bolts, something neither of us wanted to know about, being practically professional protesters of everything explosive. In for a day without a reservation, he slept on our couch. Polly kicked out the schnitzel-eating unexchanged student\u2014her phrase\u2014she was sleeping with. For virginity\u2019s sake, she said, even though Dad had already walked into our dorm room once before when it was overpopulated.\n\nMr. Schmeckler\u2019s sitting on my bed when I return from the prof\u2019s house.\n\nWhere\u2019s Mom?\n\nShe had an appointment. To get her hair done, he adds. That\u2019s as lame as it gets. His face goes ablaze with an Irish blush. We\u2019re divorcing, he says, as if that\u2019s what Mom\u2019s hair-doing is really for.\n\nI take Polly\u2019s bed. Catholics can\u2019t get a divorce, I say.\n\nMom\u2014\n\nPolly walks in. My Indian blouse looks great on her without a bra, eggs sunny-side up with nipples. Her big smile for Dad changes, seeing me.\n\n\nAt dinner they talk about the Vietnam War, how Johnson is bluffing, how contracts for bolts are increasing, and how evil he is, given that any contract will involve defense money. But the bolts protect the boys, he pleads to Polly, who is adamant that all manufacturing of anything out of that budget hurts someone. It\u2019s all entwined, she says, ordering another drink for herself. They drink a lot, and so do I. The three of us are loud enough that on our way back the watchman at the school gate reprimands Dad, who bows.\n\nI fall asleep on my bed without turning off my light, even before Dad leaves.\n\nMom doesn\u2019t call. I can\u2019t believe it. I am going to England for months, maybe even a year, and she doesn\u2019t even want to say good-bye, or tell me what\u2019s going on. I am devastated. Polly says not to call her, it isn\u2019t my place, a mother\u2019s supposed to console the daughter in a divorce. After all, I am the hurt one, whilst they go on their merry ways.\n\nDad doesn\u2019t show up in Europe this time, nor in the fall we decide to stay on for. Polly gets me through. We eat toad-in-the-hole and date Oxford men, and I find one that Polly tolerates, though he\u2019s Tasmanian, not really English. A devil nonetheless. We marry during a bright patch of winter on a hillside in Spain, with Polly at my side, along with the prof who supervised her, and several just-sheared sheep. My parents pitch in for the honeymoon in France but don\u2019t show, singly or together.\n\nPolly doesn\u2019t take the prof home but flies back to the grad school he helped her get into. When I return, I enroll for a law degree and don\u2019t see my parents for another three months, not until my brother calls me to report that my mother has taken to her bed. I visit and she\u2019s so ill she can\u2019t make me pancakes. I stay with my father instead, and his new wife, two years my junior. He sits me down in their living room and makes me read the divorce papers as a test of the new legal knowledge he is paying for. He wants to see if old Mr. McKibben is up-to-date.\n\nWhat I learn is this: Dad and his new wife now own this large house on the Cape and they want for nothing. My mother, one foot in the grave, wants. The document\u2019s formal tone can\u2019t hide her diminishment. While I page through it, I wonder at my own newly married state and how little I know of its future petitions and adjournments. I almost don\u2019t read to the end, which, in a brief, is the beginning, where the facts, such as they are, are depositioned. Maybe I know them already and don\u2019t want to read them.\n\nPolly is named.\n\nOf course he can\u2019t tell me himself. I look around at all the chintz coverings, the wicker and glass, seeing nothing. By insisting I read these papers, is he trying to warn me away from Polly? Or get even with Polly by hurting me? Or am I guilty too now, knowing, since she is my friend?\n\nIt looks good to me, I tell him.\n\nHow happy Dad had been to visit me in schnitzel-land, staying three extra days.\n\n\nA year later Polly hears that I\u2019m back in town with a position, not practicing law but close to it, teaching it not far from her grad school. We sit at a table with a bottle of wine between us, and a husband each to drink it, mine who whispers, Your dad? We speak of solemn things, all the dead in the war so far, the iconic picture of the man holding a pistol to another man\u2019s head, the Beatles\u2019 breakup. I bring up this last topic, feeling brazen by the bottle\u2019s draining, feeling I can lower the tone and open the dialogue with the terrible shattering of the Fab Four\u2019s friendship over what, a mere Love-In girlfriend?\n\nThe two men have long ago begun a side chat about guy trivia, stocks, like they care, and varieties of woods-of-the-world, her guy being a carpenter who is building her a huge house out of lumber he steals from the sites he works on. My Tasmanian admires his moxie, but their conversation lulls with my Beatles trivia, which opens a big, quiet hole.\n\nIt was like a marriage, the Beatles had a contract, I say, the lawyer in me still so new. The breakup of the century. Yoko betrayed them all.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Polly says out of nowhere.\n\nI hadn\u2019t believed what I had read in the divorce papers until then. I was certain my mother had fabricated everything, my mother now unable to talk at all and without a new mate with an expensive porch overlooking the ocean, or any mate. I had called her on her birthday but she wouldn\u2019t say anything, her nurse very gently hanging up on me. Now I don\u2019t have anything smart to say back to Polly, nothing graceful or forgiving is going to come out of my mouth in answer.\n\nWe were best friends, is what I say. And before she can color that with something consoling, I head toward the ladies\u2019 but I don\u2019t go, I find the door and sit in the car until my husband locates me, as husbands are wont to do, on a hunch. I don\u2019t cry either, although decades later my shrink says I should have.\n\n\nPolly persists. She wants the last word, she wants more than that, she wants our friendship to continue, as a sign of my forgiveness. But by associating with Polly, I caused the divorce and thus my mother\u2019s illness, and when she dies, my mother leaves what she has to my brother. Somehow Polly sees the obit and sends a condolence note. She also sends me birthday and Christmas presents, with Love in the note that\u2019s tucked into whatever. We still share friends from college, and once we bump into each other by accident. She has Clintonian drive: if one person at a party resists her, that\u2019s the one she must amuse. I resist\u2014and she showers me with wit and concern. Who else knows me best, and so relentlessly? Then, because my mother, who didn\u2019t know me at all, is dead, I invite Polly to the Cape when my father is away.\n\nShe has divorced the carpenter\u2014he finished the house\u2014and found a research partner from Australia, a woman without any history between them who can write with her, Polly having, via osmosis with me, I suppose, become unable to finish her own academic papers, and she invites her and the woman\u2019s husband along. Buffers, I decide, being tentative, in thrall to the outrageousness of my invitation, and hers. The woman and Polly are more intimate than I expect, what with academic sighs that develop into sleights-of-conversation I can\u2019t quite follow, the two of them shouting at each other from their Schwinns as we round one more lovely green view that the Cape, with its half screens of rushes and graveyards, provides. Their topic is geography, how humans have to share it, and they\u2019re popularizing their magnum opus, Down with Capitalism. I insist I\u2019m fodder for their deliberation: I do popular. Even with my advanced degree, theory like theirs is too thick. They roll their eyes.\n\nWe kick-stand our bikes at the beach, a long one with crashing waves and surfboards. While the Aussie and her husband run down to the water, Polly and I nick our knees up under our chins, waiting for water-awe to subside. Polly closes her eyes, the quickest way to dispel all that nature so close. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to, she says to me.\n\nThe Aussie is taking steps with her husband into the deep. My husband is back at the house with a cold. How about you, with your ex? I say.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the whole world, and you in it.\n\nI write a word in the sand with my toe, who knows what\u2014harbor, as in feelings? It\u2019s too long to be hate. I\u2019m so suddenly happy I can\u2019t answer her question. I watch the waves.\n\nTemporary Autonomous Zone, Polly shouts, seeing the Aussies dragging back driftwood. Together we build a little kingdom in the sand with the wood, and roll over\u2014how does it always happen?\u2014a rock throne for her to sit on.\n\n\nPolly dies before my father does, asphyxiating on a plane in the middle of an intellectual point, a peanut stuck in her windpipe.\n\nMy father, out-Schmecklered by his newest wife, does not say, How fitting. I do not know if he cast Polly away so many years ago, or if the divorce lawyer said to cool it, and cool Polly never returned. Or perhaps she did return. I do not ask. I stand on his porch after telling him the news, facing the water Polly and I had watched, eating its way up the beach toward him.\n\nShe was my friend and whatever he thinks to say about her, he is not worthy to say it.\n\n"

Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\n\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\n\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\n\nOf course a train was coming.\n\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he\u2019d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\n\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I\u2019ll watch for deer instead.\n\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\n\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\n\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\n\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\n\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles.

Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\n\nThat\u2019s what they call pinto, right? she says.\n\nAppaloosa. Pinto\u2019s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\n\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\n\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you\u2014or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\n\nWhat a good idea\u2014the weight of justice on the plaintiff\u2019s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\n\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town\u2019s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked caf\u00e9.\n\nThis is what education\u2019s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques\u2014this one\u2019s antique food.\n\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You\u2019re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\n\nIf I\u2019m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\n\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years, she says.\n\nA person gets marked, says her father. She\u2019s a marked woman.\n\nDad, she says. That\u2019s right out of the movies.\n\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\n\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\n\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it\u2014with the cattle market the way it is. And they can\u2019t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\n\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\n\nShe\u2019s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who\u2019s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\n\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\n\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she\u2019s in season.\n\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\n\nWe\u2019re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\n\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That\u2019ll qualify.\n\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\n\nNot Dad, the guy who won\u2019t wear a seat belt.\n\nSeat belts? That\u2019s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father\u2019s forehead. He\u2019s got imagination. He\u2019s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\n\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I\u2019m just a farmer with opinions. That\u2019s why they elected me.\n\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\n\nThat\u2019s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\n\nThe coffee\u2019s actually good, says the attorney.\n\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\n\nThe attorney picks it up.\n\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That\u2019s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\n\nThey file out of the caf\u00e9 onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\n\nOh, there\u2019s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he\u2019s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They\u2019re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\n\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\n\nHey, says the attorney. It could\u2019ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else\u2019s problem entirely.\n\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How\u2019s your digestion? she asks.\n\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff\u2019s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\n\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It\u2019s a wonder they can stand upright.\n\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\n\nThey\u2019re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There\u2019s a cow meet this afternoon, and we\u2019ve got the best wranglers inside.\n\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\n\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\n\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he\u2019s being paid to do it. They don\u2019t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\n\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here\u2019s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here\u2019s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\n\nYou just don\u2019t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\n\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\n\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\n\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\n\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don\u2019t have to stick around here if you don\u2019t want to, he says to her.\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\n\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\n\nThat\u2019s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\n\nI don\u2019t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\n\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They\u2019ll fight it.\n\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they\u2019ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I\u2019ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\n\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\n\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn\u2019t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\n\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I\u2019ll tell them.\n\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I\u2019ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they\u2019ll really pay.\n\nAh, civilization, she says.\n\nHe\u2019s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I\u2019ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\n\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\n\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\n\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\n\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.\n\n"
