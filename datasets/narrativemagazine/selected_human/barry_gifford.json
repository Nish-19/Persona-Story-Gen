        "comment": "As soon as Jimmy Boyle got back from Ireland, he went to see his friends. Roy, the Viper, Magic Frank, and Crazy Lester were hanging out under the viaduct on the corner of Warsaw and Bohemia, near Heart-of-Jesus Park. It was a late Friday afternoon in August, and Jimmy knew he\u2019d find them there because the league games were over by four or four-thirty, and the boys liked to stay around for a while afterward to talk about what happened. Jimmy had gone to Ireland for a holiday with his mother, his grandmother, and his sister. They were there for two weeks, and he was happy to be back in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Viper was the first to spot Boyle.\n\n\u201cHey, Jimmy! Did you kiss the Blarney Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all of us did, even my grandmother. We had to hold her by her legs. You gotta bend over backwards to do it. My ma got pictures of me and my sister there. What\u2019d I miss?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoy hit two homers today,\u201d said Lester.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always hittin\u2019 homers,\u201d said Magic Frank. \u201cThat ain\u2019t news.\u201d\n\n\u201cRed Dietz got killed,\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cNo shit,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know Red Dietz,\u201d said Roy, \u201cthe one-armed pitcher on Margaret Mary\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Lost his right up to the elbow when he stuck it out a window on the Illinois Central.\u201d\n\n\u201cA line drive hit him right between the eyes in a game last week,\u201d said the Viper. \u201cDietz died on the mound.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho hit it?\u201d\n\n\u201cVidinski,\u201d said Roy, \u201cthe third baseman for Mohegan Mortuary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey picked up the tab for the funeral,\u201d said Frank.\n\n\u201cDid you guys go?\u201d asked Jimmy.\n\n\u201cNobody liked Red Dietz,\u201d said the Viper. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody that went.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother did,\u201d said Lester. \u201cShe dyes Dietz\u2019s mother\u2019s hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was all pissed off all the time,\u201d said Frank.\n\n\u201cYou lost an arm, you\u2019d probably be pissed off all the time, too,\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cSo what was the best thing about Ireland?\u201d the Viper asked Jimmy.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t get so hot and humid in the summer like here. There\u2019s a river goes through Dublin that\u2019s pretty nice. Lots of old buildings and churches, stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo the people speak English or Irish?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cBoth, I guess. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t understand what they were sayin\u2019 in English. You know, like Cunningham\u2019s mother. My grandmother speaks Gaelic pretty good and my ma, too, so we didn\u2019t have no problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about girls?\u201d asked Lester.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t hardly see any except for my cousin, Kathleen. She\u2019s a couple years older, fifteen. We stayed with her family. One night after she took a bath, she came out in a towel and asked me if I wanted to use her bathwater while it was still warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d already bathed in it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cThey share it \u2019cause there ain\u2019t so much hot water.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad you couldn\u2019ta shared it with her,\u201d said Lester.\n\n\u201cShe showed me her tits,\u201d said Jimmy.\n\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d said Frank.\n\nJimmy nodded. \u201cShe did. Nobody else was around. Opened the towel and rewrapped it standin\u2019 in front of me. They were the two best things I seen in Ireland.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere they big?\u201d asked the Viper.\n\n\u201cAverage,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cThere were freckles all over \u2019em and the nipples pointed up.\u201d\n\nClouds blocked the sun, and suddenly the air felt cooler.\n\n\u201cAnybody hungry?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Cottage,\u201d said Frank, \u201cget fries with gravy.\u201d\n\nThe boys began walking west on Warsaw, toward Pulaski. Roy and Jimmy Boyle trailed the others.\n\n\u201cDo you think your cousin wanted to do somethin\u2019 with you?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cYou think girls in Dublin are any different than the ones in Chicago?\u201d\n\nBefore Roy could offer an opinion, a police car drove up and stopped in the street next to them. There were two cops in it, one driving and one riding shotgun.\n\nThe cop in the front passenger seat leaned out his window and said, \u201cAny of you seen two colored boys drive by in a lime green Cadillac?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t,\u201d said Frank.\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d said Lester.\n\nRoy and the Viper shook their heads.\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d the cop asked Jimmy Boyle.\n\n\u201cI just got back from Ireland,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou go blind from drinkin\u2019 the water over there?\u201d said the cop.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jimmy.\n\n\u201cThey got coloreds in Ireland?\u201d the cop asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seen his cousin Kathleen\u2019s tits, though,\u201d said Lester.\n\nThe cop stared at Lester for a moment. Crazy Lester was grinning.\n\n\u201cAre you Irish?\u201d the cop said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lester. \u201cI\u2019m Lithuanian on my mother\u2019s side and Moldavian on my dad\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better watch yourself,\u201d said the cop.\n\nThen the police car drove away.\n\n"

        "comment": "ROY READ IN A SCIENCE BOOK about a parasite that lives in water and enters the skin of human beings, goes to the head, and causes loss of sight. This condition, Roy learned, was sometimes called river blindness. Soon after he\u2019d read this, Roy was taken on a Friday night by his cousin Ray to Rita\u2019s Can\u2019t Take It With You, a blues club on the West Side. Ray was twenty-two, six years older than Roy. Ray had recently enlisted in the navy and wanted to celebrate before leaving for boot camp the following Monday. The cousins were accompanied to Rita\u2019s by Ray\u2019s friend Marvin Kitna, an accordionist in a polka band who had been to the club several times before.\n\n\u201cThe Wolf\u2019s playing tonight,\u201d Kitna told Roy and Ray. \u201cHe\u2019s gettin\u2019 up there, but he\u2019s still the best.\u201d\n\nRoy, Ray, and Marvin Kitna were the only white patrons that night in Rita\u2019s Can\u2019t Take It With You. Kitna seemed to know almost everybody there, from the two bartenders, Earl and Lee, to many of the customers, as well as the two off-duty Chicago cops, Malcolm and Durrell, who were paid to provide security.\n\nRoy let his cousin and Kitna order beers and shots of Jim Beam for the three of them. The waitress, whom Marvin addressed as Dolangela, and who favored them with a dazzling dental display of gold and silver, did not ask any of them, even Roy, for verification of their ages.\n\nRoy slowly sipped his beer and kept his mouth shut. He did not touch the shot of bourbon. The Wolf put on a great performance, crawling around on the stage, lying on his back while playing guitar, and emitting his trademark howl. Ray and Marvin Kitna got up and danced a couple of times with girls Kitna knew. Roy was content to sit still and take in the show.\n\nAfter the boys had been there for about an hour, a girl came over to their table, pulled up a chair, and sat down between Roy and Ray.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said to Roy. \u201cMy name\u2019s Esmeraldina. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got beautiful hair, Roy. You mind do I touch it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nEsmeraldina ran the fingers of her right hand through Roy\u2019s wavy black hair.\n\n\u201cYou Eyetalian?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYou an Eyetalian boy, huh?\u201d\n\nRoy shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m mostly Irish,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPretty Eyetalian boy with turquoise eyes.\u201d\n\nEsmeraldina draped her left arm around Roy\u2019s shoulders while she played with his hair.\n\n\u201cJust go along with her, Roy,\u201d said Marvin Kitna. \u201cShe won\u2019t bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I do,\u201d Esmeraldina said. \u201cI surely do can bite when a particular feelin\u2019 comin\u2019 on.\u201d\n\nShe poured Roy\u2019s shot of Beam into his glass of beer and picked up the glass.\n\n\u201cYou mind do I take a taste?\u201d she asked Roy.\n\nRoy shook his head no, and Esmeraldina drank half the contents.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that particular feelin\u2019 you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about, Esmeraldina?\u201d asked Roy\u2019s cousin.\n\nShe grinned, revealing a perfect row of teeth unadorned by metal, and replied, \u201cWhen a man get under my skin, crawl all up inside so\u2019s I can\u2019t itch it or see straight. Happens, I ain\u2019t responsible for myself, what I do until the feelin\u2019 wear off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long\u2019s that take?\u201d asked Marvin Kitna.\n\n\u201cDepends on the man,\u201d Esmeraldina said.\n\n\u201cLike river blindness,\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, honey?\u201d\n\n\u201cA water bug swims in through a person\u2019s pores up to their head and makes them go blind.\u201d\n\nEsmeraldina stared for a long moment into Roy\u2019s eyes, then kissed him softly on the mouth.\n\n\u201cI bet you know all kinds of interestin\u2019 things, Roy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to dance with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\nEsmeraldina picked up Roy\u2019s glass and finished off the shot and the beer before they headed to the dance floor. Jimmie \u201cFast Fingers\u201d Dawkins\u2019 \u201cAll for Business\u201d was playing on the jukebox. She pressed her skinny body hard against Roy\u2019s and wrapped her arms around his back. Esmeraldina nudged him gently around in response to the slow blues. Roy guessed that Esmeraldina was in her early twenties, but he didn\u2019t want to ask for fear she would in turn ask him how old he was, and he did not want to have to lie.\n\n\u201cHow old are you, Roy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld enough to be here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou pretty sharp. Sharp and pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very pretty yourself, Esmeraldina.\u201d\n\nAfter the song ended, Esmeraldina took Roy by the hand and led him out of the club. It was cold outside, too cold to be in the street without a coat. Roy had left his on the back of his chair at the table. Esmeraldina did not have one, either; she shivered in her short-sleeved blouse as she walked him to the right, around the corner onto Lake Street. A few yards ahead of them, two men, both wearing short-brimmed hats, were arguing. One of them pulled a gun from a pocket and shot the other man in the forehead. The man who had been shot flew off his feet backward as if he\u2019d been caught off balance by Sugar Ray Robinson\u2019s quick left hook. The shooter ran and disappeared under the El tracks. Roy looked at the man on the ground: his eyes were open and his short-brim was still on his head.\n\n\u201cBad timin\u2019,\u201d Esmeraldina said. \u201cWe\u2019d best go back indoors.\u201d\n\nShe and Roy hurried into Rita\u2019s Can\u2019t Take It With You, where Esmeraldina let go of him and lost herself in the crowd. Roy went over to the table where he\u2019d been sitting with Ray and Marvin Kitna. They weren\u2019t there. Roy looked for them on the dance floor, but he didn\u2019t see them. He took his jacket off the back of his chair and put it on. The music coming from the jukebox was very loud, but Roy could hear a police siren. He saw Malcolm and Durrell, the security guards, go out the front door followed by Earl, one of the bartenders, and several customers. Roy ducked out too, turned left, and walked as fast as he could away from Lake Street. He could still see the dead man with a nickel-sized hole above the bridge of his nose.\n\n\u201cHow could his hat have stayed on?\u201d Roy said.\n\n"

        "comment": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n"

        "comment": "Roy was twelve years old when his mother and her third husband, a jazz drummer named Sid \u201cSpanky\u201d Wade, told him that they were going to move out of Chicago to a suburb north of the city. They had already paid for the beginning of the construction of a new house, and the foundation had been laid. The next day, a Sunday, the four of them\u2014Roy\u2019s mother, her husband, Roy\u2019s one-year-old sister, and Roy\u2014drove out to see it.\n\nRoy had no desire to leave the neighborhood, and when he saw the property in Winnebago Gardens, a new development in the middle of nowhere, only sidewalks and streets and other houses under construction, no people, not even a kid on a bike, he knew immediately this place was not for him. The thought of being stranded like a lost legionnaire in the Sahara made Roy shiver. He disliked Sid Wade and Sid disliked him; and Roy\u2019s mother, as always during her marriages, was either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or in the throes of collapse. His mother\u2019s marriages\u2014of which there would eventually be five\u2014inevitably and rapidly deteriorated into disappointment and fear that found expression in the form of hysteria and vicious vitriol, behavior that terrorized not only her husband of the moment but Roy and anyone else who had to deal with her. This proposed move to the suburbs, to \u201csomewhere quiet and less stressful,\u201d as Sid Wade said, would surely salve her condition. City life made her nervous, agreed Dr. Martell, a heart specialist and old friend of Roy\u2019s grandmother\u2019s, who provided pills for his mother even in the middle of the night.\n\nSeveral days after their excursion to Winnebago Gardens, Roy was having dinner with the family when Sid Wade began telling Roy what he could and could not take with him when they moved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not moving,\u201d Roy said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll take care of my own things.\u201d\n\nSid Wade dropped his fork onto his plate, his heavy-jowled face turned crimson, and he said, \u201cOf course you\u2019re moving. We all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve already made arrangements to live next door with the McLaughlins. Mr. and Mrs. McLaughlin said it\u2019s all right with them. Jimmy\u2019s going into the army next month, so I\u2019ll have his bunk in the room with Johnny and Billy. I told Mrs. McLaughlin I\u2019d contribute money to the household out of my pay delivering for Kow Kow. I\u2019ll be fine there.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s mother stood up from the table and put her dishes in the sink. Her face was green and her lips were trembling. Her body shook and she was crying.\n\n\u201cLook what you\u2019ve done to your mother!\u201d Sid Wade shouted.\n\nRoy\u2019s little sister, upset by his loud voice, began crying too.\n\n\u201cIf your father were here,\u201d Wade snarled, \u201che wouldn\u2019t put up with your insolence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being insolent,\u201d said Roy. \u201cAnd don\u2019t talk about my father. You didn\u2019t know him and he\u2019s dead. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019d say or do. If he were alive, I\u2019d go live with him. Johnny and Billy are my best friends and Mr. and Mrs. McLaughlin are good people.\u201d\n\nFrank McLaughlin worked as a doorman at the Drake Hotel and his wife took in laundry. They were from Ireland and spoke Gaelic in their house. They let their sons drink coffee in the morning and Margaret McLaughlin made great peach and strawberry pies in the summer. Roy couldn\u2019t wait to go live with them.\n\nSid Wade and Roy\u2019s mother began arguing. She closed her eyes and fell down on the floor. The baby was screeching and Sid Wade wouldn\u2019t stop yelling, carrying on about how Roy should be sent to reform school, that he\u2019d never be any good, just like his gangster father.\n\n\u201cHe did time and you\u2019ll do time!\u201d Wade said. He snorted like a buffalo and his little eyes disappeared.\n\nRoy could hear his mother moaning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing your mother!\u201d screamed Wade, though he made no attempt to pick her up off the floor, where she was now writhing like a Moroccan fakir\u2019s cobra being replaced in its basket.\n\nRoy rose from the table and walked out the back door, down the steps, through the yard, and into the alley behind the garage. It was windy and cold and he was wearing only a T-shirt. Mr. Anderson\u2019s old red Studebaker was parked in the alley between his house and the McLaughlins\u2019. Roy knew that Mr. Anderson never locked it, so he walked over, opened the passenger-side door, and got in. He sat there looking through the windshield. The sky was almost dark, there was a thin, pale-yellow ribbon running through the gray. At the far end of the alley two men came out of the rear door of the Green Harp tavern. They were smoking and laughing. One of them was wearing a blue zipper jacket and the other was wearing a brown one. Both men were hatless. Roy watched them standing and talking and smoking, their hair waving in the wind. Mr. Anderson had left an open pack of Lucky Strikes on top of the dashboard. Roy took one, put it between his lips, and punched in the lighter.\n\n\n\nThree months later, Roy\u2019s mother told him that Sid had defaulted on their installments for the house in Winnebago Gardens and forfeited the down payment, so they weren\u2019t going to move there. A week after that, Roy came home from school one day and found Sid Wade picking up his clothes and other belongings from in front of the house, where Roy\u2019s mother had thrown them. Later the same day Sid moved out and Roy\u2019s mother said she was divorcing him and going to work as a receptionist in Dr. Martell\u2019s office.\n\nJimmy McLaughlin came home from the army on leave for a few days after completing basic training. Roy and Johnny and Billy were sitting on Johnny\u2019s bunk listening to him. Jimmy was lying on his bed in his uniform smoking a Chesterfield, telling them about life at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Johnny had taken over Jimmy\u2019s job washing dishes at the Chinese restaurant, Roy had taken over Johnny\u2019s delivery days, and Billy, the youngest McLaughlin brother, a year younger than Johnny and Roy, who were five years younger than Jimmy, now worked at Kow Kow too, sweeping up and taking out the garbage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back home,\u201d Jimmy said, \u201ceven if it\u2019s only for a week. You don\u2019t know how much you miss it until you can\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you miss the most?\u201d asked Johnny.\n\n\u201cStrange things, little things, mostly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Like what?\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cJust seein\u2019 Mr. Anderson\u2019s red \u201952 Studebaker parked in the alley is one, I guess. It gives me a good feelin\u2019 knowin\u2019 it\u2019s still there.\u201d\n"

        "comment": "Roy met Tina at the Cuban Brotherhood Club and Dance Hall in Tampa, Florida, when he was fourteen. Roy was spending the summer with his uncle Buck, working construction on weekdays, resting on Saturdays, and fishing on Sundays. Tina was a local girl who went with her girlfriends to the dances at the Cuban Club on Saturday nights.\n\nRoy and his friend Ralph were fascinated by the big-eyed dusky Cuban girls who had come to Florida with their families in the first wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9s who fled the island following the revolution. These girls wore makeup, bright red lipstick, large gold hoop earrings, and short skirts. They danced only with one another and did not speak to white boys. Mostly they sat together in folding chairs in a corner of the dance hall and never stopped chattering and gesturing dramatically. Roy spoke some Spanish but when he got close enough to overhear their conversations, they spoke so rapidly and without fully pronouncing most of their words that he could not understand anything they were saying.\n\nTina didn\u2019t like the Cuban girls. She was tall and blonde, as was her friend, LaDonna. When Roy asked Tina to dance she asked him what he thought of the Cuban girls. Before he could answer, Tina said, \u201cThey\u2019re cheap. They have big asses and dress like whores. LaDonna says her mother told her that their fathers have sex with them starting when they\u2019re five.\u201d\n\nRoy found this hard to believe. He worked laying sewer pipe and shooting streets with Cuban men and liked them. They were good workers, glad to have a job, and they laughed a lot. Most of the time Roy didn\u2019t get their jokes\u2014they spoke as rapidly as the girls at the dances\u2014but they always offered to share their homemade lunches with Roy. He loved the Cuban food: lech\u00f3n and pollo asado, platanos maduros, black beans and yellow rice.\n\nTina had blue eyes with yellow spots in them, an almost pretty face, and a terrific figure. She and LaDonna wore as much makeup as or more than the Cuban girls.\n\n\u201cAre you from around here?\u201d Tina asked Roy. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk like you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m down here staying with my uncle for the summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost seventeen,\u201d said Tina. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sixteen in October,\u201d Roy lied.\n\nTina was a little taller than Roy. She had slender, muscular arms and held him tightly, pulling him around during a slow dance. Her new breasts were as hard as her arms. She pushed herself against Roy and he got excited.\n\n\u201cI can tell you like me, Roy,\u201d Tina said, and smiled. Her teeth were crooked and up close Roy could see the pimples beneath cracks in her makeup.\n\nRalph was trying to get one of the Cuban girls to talk to him, and LaDonna was dancing with a heavyset guy whose ears were perpendicular to his head. Tina told Roy that his name was Woody and that he was one of LaDonna\u2019s exes. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of \u2019em,\u201d Tina said.\n\nAfter the slow dance Roy and Tina got cups of lemonade at the host table and stood off to the side.\n\n\u201cDo you want to walk me home?\u201d Tina asked him. \u201cI live four blocks from here. I don\u2019t much like the music they\u2019re playing tonight, and my parents make me come home early.\u201d\n\nWhen they got to her house, a white, wooden bungalow set on concrete blocks with a wide front porch with a swing on it, Tina said, \u201cCome in with me. My parents go to bed right after Perry Mason and then we can sneak out and go down to the river.\u201d\n\nTina introduced Roy to Ed and Irma, both of whom Tina addressed by their given names, not by Mom and Dad, which Roy had never heard a kid do before. Ed and Irma sat in separate armchairs in the small living room watching Raymond Burr be a lawyer on their black-and-white Motorola. Roy and Tina sat slightly apart from each other on a lumpy couch. Ed and Irma did not say anything until the program was over. Ed stood up and turned off the television set after the theme music finished playing over the end credits.\n\n\u201cMan never loses a case,\u201d he said.\n\nEd had a huge belly and big arms. So did Irma. They both said goodnight and left the room. Tina put her right hand on Roy\u2019s left leg and squeezed his thigh. As soon as Tina heard the door to her parents\u2019 bedroom close and the lock click, she turned to Roy and kissed him hard on the mouth.\n\nTina stood, took Roy\u2019s left hand, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go down to the river and sit on the pier.\u201d\n\nThe river was at the end of Tina\u2019s street. She led him past a dwarf palm tree that was bent halfway over to a short pier and pulled him down onto the planks.\n\n\u201cLie back,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were no boats moving on the water, and except for insect noises it was quiet. Tina lay on top of Roy and rubbed her body against his. They kissed a few times with their mouths closed, then Tina rolled onto her side and with one hand unzipped his fly. Roy\u2019s cock popped up like a jack-in-the-box and Tina wrapped her right hand around it. He stared at the crescent moon as she stroked him slowly for a minute or so and then Roy tried to get up and lie on top of her. Tina pushed him back down, held him prostrate with her ropey arms, straddled his legs, and put his cock into her mouth. Roy came immediately.\n\nTina rolled off of him and spat into the water, turned back to Roy, and said, \u201cYou have a good dick, I think.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, so Roy did too. He zipped up his pants. Tina had already begun walking back off the pier. They walked to her house without saying anything. Tina stopped in front of her porch steps. No lights were on. She stretched out her arms and rested them on Roy\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be at the Cuban Club next Saturday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going with Ed and Irma to Milwaukee on Monday. That\u2019s where Mamie, Irma\u2019s mother, lives. I have a cousin there, Ronnie. He\u2019s the only boy I let fuck me. He\u2019s twenty-one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been letting him do it?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cSince a couple of months before my thirteenth birthday. This will be the fifth year. I only see Ronnie in the summer when we visit Mamie. Ronnie\u2019s getting married in September.\u201d\n\nTina kissed Roy on the mouth and this time she stuck her tongue in. Roy watched her go up the steps and into the house. He saw Irma sitting on the swing in the dark, smoking a cigarette.\n\n\u201cGo on now, boy,\u201d she said.\n\n"

        "post_title": "The Exception",
        "comment": "Tampa, Florida, was a sleepy fishing and cigar-manufacturing city in the 1950s, when Roy\u2019s Uncle Buck, his mother\u2019s brother, moved there and went into the construction business. Roy enjoyed visiting Tampa, which was easy to do from either Key West or Havana, the two places Roy\u2019s mother preferred spending time when Roy was a boy, before they went to live in Chicago. Roy\u2019s mother would often leave him with her brother while she traveled elsewhere. Roy was happiest when he got to hang out with his Uncle Buck, taking fishing trips in the Gulf of Mexico or just accompanying him while he did business in Tampa.\n\nOne of Buck\u2019s closest associates was his poker buddy, Chino Valdes, who owned the Oriente Bank in Ybor City. Chino\u2019s real first name was Nestor, but everyone, including Roy, called him Chino because his narrow, slanted eyes gave him an Asian appearance.\n\n\u201cKnow why I\u2019m called Chino?\u201d he asked Roy.\n\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2019Cause my grandmother had a little yen.\u201d\n\nChino was a partner in a nightclub on the outskirts of Tampa named El Para\u00edso bajo las Estrellas, where he and Roy\u2019s uncle often met. Buck took Roy along with him to El Para\u00edso several times in the afternoons, letting his nephew sit at the bar and order Coca-Colas and watch the showgirls rehearse while he and Chino discussed matters of mutual importance.\n\nIt was on one of these afternoons at El Para\u00edso that Roy was present during a murder, an event about which he was sworn to secrecy by his uncle and Chino Valdes.\n\nThis incident occurred the day before Roy\u2019s twelfth birthday. He and his uncle had arrived at El Para\u00edso shortly after two in the afternoon. Chino was already there, sitting at a table by himself, sipping Methusalem rum on the rocks. Roy and Buck walked over to Chino, who stood up and shook hands with both of them. Chino then sat down, as did Buck.\n\n\u201cGo watch the girls, Roy,\u201d said Chino, and handed the boy a five-dollar bill. \u201cIt\u2019s educational. The drinks are on me.\u201d\n\nRoy smiled at Chino, thanked him, and went over to the bar and climbed up on a stool. He placed the five down in front of him and when the bartender came over, said hello and ordered a Coke. Roy liked the bartender, Alfredito, a short, thin, bald-headed man with a mustache that looked like two caterpillars crawling toward each other. Alfredito never charged Roy for his drinks. The five-dollar bill that Chino gave Roy, as he did every time Roy came in, was to be left on the bar as a tip for Alfredito.\n\nThe dancers were onstage, practicing their routines. Most of them were coffee-colored Cuban girls. They wore short shorts and little tops that left their midriffs bare. Roy thought they were all beautiful.\n\n\u201cHow come you never look at the dancers?\u201d Roy asked Alfredito. \u201cYou always keep your back to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an old man, chico,\u201d said Alfredito. \u201cI have grandchildren older than some of these girls. It is for their sake that I don\u2019t turn around. When they look at me, I see pity in their eyes. I want to spare them the pain.\u201d\n\nRoy remembered a story his uncle had told him after the first time they\u2019d gone together to El Para\u00edso. It was about one of the dancers, a brunette originally from Matanzas named Soslaya Zancera, who was billed as the Ava Gardner of Cuba. Soslaya was the star of the show, and the girlfriend of one of the owners, Morris Perlstein. One night Perlstein caught her giving head in her dressing room to a club bouncer, Roberto Bulto, and shot Bulto dead before he could pull his cock out of Soslaya\u2019s mouth. Perlstein then fired two bullets into the girl\u2019s buttocks when she attempted to flee. The owner was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to twenty years in prison. His mistress survived, but her injuries put an end to her career as a dancer. Roy\u2019s uncle told him that Soslaya now walked with the aid of two canes and worked as a manicurist at the Hotel Khartoum in Miami Beach.\n\nRoy looked over at the table where his uncle and Chino Valdes were sitting. A third man had joined them, a large, pale-faced person wearing a mauve guayabera, a panama hat, and dark glasses. Roy noticed that the man\u2019s fingernails were painted blood red. He had never before seen a man wearing nail polish.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that guy?\u201d Roy asked Alfredito.\n\n\u201cCherry Dos Rios. From Fort Lauderdale.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the construction business.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike my uncle.\u201d\n\nAlfredito nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good business to be in.\u201d\n\nRoy returned his attention to the girls. Music came from a tape recorder because the band was there only at night. Alfredito told Roy the musicians slept during the day.\n\nSuddenly there was a loud popping sound, and the dancers stopped. Roy looked around and saw Chino Valdes hand a revolver to a man in a green seersucker suit, who walked quickly out of the club. Cherry Dos Rios sat slumped in his chair, a large dark stain spreading under his guayabera. His panama was on the table. He still had on the dark glasses. Someone turned off the music.\n\nRoy\u2019s uncle came over to him and said, \u201cV\u00e1monos, sobrino.\u201d\n\nChino stood up and came over too.\n\n\u201cChico,\u201d he said to Roy, placing a hand on the boy\u2019s left shoulder, \u201cyour uncle and I know that we can depend on your not having witnessed this unfortunate little accident.\u201d\n\nRoy looked at Chino and nodded.\n\n\u201cBuck tells me that tomorrow is your birthday. Here\u2019s something from me.\u201d\n\nChino handed Roy a hundred-dollar bill. Roy had never held one before.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re anything like your uncle,\u201d Chino said, \u201cI know you\u2019ll use it well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Roy. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nThe dancers had disappeared. Two men were dragging Cherry Dos Rios\u2019s limp corpse into a back room. As Roy and his uncle walked together out of El Para\u00edso, Roy saw Alfredito pick up Cherry Dos Rios\u2019s hat off the table at which he\u2019d been sitting. Alfredito waved it at Roy and smiled.\n\nAs Buck pulled his white 1958 Eldorado convertible onto Gasparilla Road, he asked, \u201cWould you like me to put the top down?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Roy.\n\nHis uncle unhooked the latch on his side and Roy undid the one on his, then Buck flipped a switch on the dashboard and the top peeled back. The warm Gulf air felt good on Roy\u2019s face and in his hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time you started to think about what profession you want to go into when you get older,\u201d said his uncle. \u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong in the construction business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlfredito told me the guy who accidentally got shot was in the construction business.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s uncle picked a cigar out of a box he kept on the front seat next to him, bit off one end, spit the leaves out his window, and pushed in the dash lighter.\n\n\u201cForget about him, Roy,\u201d said Buck. \u201cHe was the exception.\u201d\n\n"

        "comment": "Roy read a story about a tribe of female warriors who interrupted the con\ufb02ict between the Greeks and the Trojans in their quest for males to assist in the propagation of their race. These women called themselves Amazons and were led by Penthesilea, who, as had the rest of the tribe, severed her right breast in order to more swiftly and easily draw back her bow. The most exciting part of the story, Roy thought, was the Amazon queen\u2019s confrontation with the champion of the Greeks, Achilles, whose ferocity in battle attracted Penthesilea as no man ever had. For the \ufb01rst time she encountered a man she could consider her equal.\n\nThe idea of a tribe of brave, vicious, single-breasted women was almost beyond the comprehension of Roy\u2019s eleven-year-old mind. He drew pictures of the Amazons as he imagined them, naked, tall, and lean, their long hair tied back with leather thongs.\n\nRoy asked his grandfather if he\u2019d ever read this story.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Pops, \u201cit\u2019s in The Iliad, by Homer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI kind of found it by accident on a table at the library. Do you think there really ever was a tribe of savage women like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think savage is the correct word for them, Roy. They knew what they were doing. The Amazons wanted to be independent of men, the problem being that they needed men to impregnate them in order to keep their race from dying out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they only wanted girls, right?\u201d\n\nPops nodded.\n\n\u201cThen what did they do with boy babies?\u201d\n\n\u201cKilled at birth,\u201d Pops said. \u201cDrowned them or slit their throats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a story, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cHomer made it all up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Pops, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of truth to it. Even today many Chinese drown their female babies because they think they\u2019re worth less than men.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they need girls to keep China going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t drown all of \u2019em.\u201d\n\nAfter talking to Pops, Roy walked over to the park to see if anybody was playing ball. Halfway there it started to rain, so Roy ducked under a canopy in front of the entrance to an apartment building. A very tall, sturdily built blond lady wearing a thin black coat came out of the building. She stopped under a canopy and looked at the rain, which was falling hard.\n\n\u201cDamn!\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019ll be a bitch to get a cab.\u201d\n\nShe turned around and walked back into the building without glancing at Roy. He waited under the canopy for a few more minutes until the rain let up a little, then ran back to his house.\n\nPops was sitting in the kitchen eating a chopped chicken liver sandwich and drinking a beer.\n\n\u201cI thought you were going to the park to play ball,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a game. Maybe I\u2019ll go when it stops raining.\u201d\n\nHe opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the leader of the Amazons called?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cA virago,\u201d said Pops.\n\n\u201cIs that the same as queen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need a king to have a queen, Roy. No, a virago is a termagant.\u201d\n\n\u201cTermagant? That sounds like an insect.\u201d\n\nPops bit into his sandwich.\n\n\u201cIt means a big, tough woman,\u201d he said, as he chewed.\n\n\u201cI guess the Chinese don\u2019t want any of them,\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Pops said. \u201cClose the refrigerator door.\u201d\n\n"
