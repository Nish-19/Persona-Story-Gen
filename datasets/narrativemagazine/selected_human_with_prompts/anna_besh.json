        "comment": "You have always seemed important to me. Always the tall one, the quiet tall one. The thoughtful tall one. Eyes honest and blue, sometimes overwhelming like the stormy Pacific; hair disheveled, honey-gold, like the light that comes just before sunset; freckles spattered across face and shoulders like stars that have been carefully counted and then forgotten, left to their own rambunctious devices to build constellations. These were not the things I first noticed about you.\n\nRather, I took notice of the way you talked. An almost Southern accent that you reined in just before a remnant of Georgia or Alabama slid off the tongue; the way you never seemed to feel the need to fill the empty space with meaningless conversation; the way you sometimes leaned forward onto countertops, propping your chin on the heel of your hand, level with whoever had provoked your slight side smile.\n\nI took notice of how it felt to be near you, of the way that you drove, the music you played in your car, how you took your coffee. I noticed the books that you read, the stories with which you chose to fill your mind. You made me remember the smell of damp moss and Robin Hood. The little lost prince, and sunlit trees.\n\nI liked remembering these things. Somehow I felt like I\u2019d known you before. I still feel like I\u2019ve known you before\u2014somewhere in the distant past, fifty years or eons ago. Your soul feels old and familiar like a book that opens to my favorite pages.\n\nOnce I drove your car home after an entire night spent in the dark\u2014a group of us trudging along to the top of a mountain at what must have been a vertical incline. We made it, although the only view awaiting us at the peak was that of the stars in the night sky, which we could have seen just as well at sea level. We laughed at how ridiculous we had been and ate dark chocolate dipped in peanut butter and shielded our faces from the wind.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t slept, the handful of us. I was the most awake, so I drove us all home. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sun had just started stirring, verging on getting up and starting the day, on waking the world with a quiet peek over the mountains. We were fifty miles away from home and we were in your car. You sat shotgun, the other two asleep in the back seat.\n\nI remember the stillness, the quietness, the blueness, the haziness. The whole world seemed groggy eyed, gentle; maybe asking for five more minutes of darkness. I remember feeling you beside me and how normal it seemed; I\u2019d learned your rhythms long ago and found them easy. Beside you, I felt like I was home again after spending too long abroad. I had a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like you were an old soul from eons ago who had returned to me once before in a similar way. I could have cried because you were so close to me.\n\nThe asphalt stretched out before us, swallowed up by the mountains in the distance. I made slow sweeping turns and gentle stops, watching heads lulling in the rearview mirror, and sometimes I stole glances over at you.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d I wanted to know, and something about the dewy world around us made me feel like we could start fresh with honest and sincere questions. How are you, since we haven\u2019t really spoken in over a year, since you used to be relevant to my life and I to yours, since I still miss you. And what I really want to know is if you ever think about that time when we at least pretended to be close to one another, and whether you were faking it, and whether I was faking it. And what I want to know even more is if you think you will ever allow me to know you again, and whether you will ever want to know me again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d You almost said more but stopped yourself.\n\nYou looked over at me, and I smiled because I recognized something in your eyes. You had grown older and taller, your shoulders broader, your hair longer, but your eyes were the same. And then I played a song that I knew you\u2019d recognize. Maybe it was a bit unfair\u2014you hadn\u2019t asked for a trip down memory lane\u2014but I was prompted by the blue sunrise and all the things I wanted to say but couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI like when you can see the layers of mountains\u2014I can count seven,\u201d you said.\n\nI turned the music down, gripped the steering wheel a bit tighter, and responded, \u201cI count nine\u2014wait no, maybe just seven. I\u2019m not sure, really; I\u2019ve never tried counting them before. I like how some of them are almost transparent, like smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too\u2014I like the colors.\u201d\n\nI waited for you to elaborate, to say something vaguely poetic, introspective, important, anything.\n\n\u201cCan you believe he has to work today?\u201d you asked, gesturing with your eyes to one of the heads dozed off in the backseat. Just like that, our moment passed. The next song came on.\n\nWe drove the rest of the way home in relatively comfortable silence. I wondered if the blue sunrise was just a product of global warming.\n\nAs I rolled into my driveway, rocks crunched beneath the tires, usually a welcome sound, but now it made me ache. I sat back and took a deep breath. Then I collected my things and opened the door.\n\n\u201cDrive safe,\u201d I said, stepping out of the car. I avoided your eyes as I swung the door shut. \u201cLet me know you make it home safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill do.\u201d\n\nI watched as you slid over to the driver\u2019s seat and adjusted the mirrors and radio. As you slowly swung out of the driveway, the sunglasses hanging from your rearview mirror swayed in time to the song stuck in my head, and sunshine glinted off the silver of your wheels. I stood there, my hand held in a half wave, then turned toward the back door of the big blue house.\n\n",

        "comment": "My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sister\u2019s gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.\n\n\u201cListen to this,\u201d she said smiling, and turned up the volume.\n\n\u201cI was trying to record you saying \u2018Dada,\u2019 but you never quite get there.\u201d\n\nThe recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. \u201cCome on, Abbie, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie I\u2019d seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would change\u2014by no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helen\u2019s three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. \u201cDo you have any idea how important you are?\u201d\n\nIn the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, \u201cGracious!\u201d Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights she\u2019d gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.\n\n\u201cWhy did you say \u2018gracious\u2019 like that?\u201d Helen mimicked our mom\u2019s slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.\n\nMom winced at the recording, and I\u2019m sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.\n\nThe tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep as long as I\u2019d hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm there\u2019d been in my body, and I was up by seven.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to take you to pick up your car?\u201d I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.\n\nWe climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along. The window caught glints of morning sun and offered snapshots of the girl I must have been once but now hardly recognized. She had a messy middle part, blonde peach-fuzz legs, and knew all the words to \u201cSteal My Kisses.\u201d\n\nWe pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperor\u2019s Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry. She held it all so naturally, each item an extension of her.\n\nThe guy helping us ushered her into her newly serviced car, and I climbed over to the driver\u2019s side of the CR-V, adjusting the mirrors and seat. Pulling out into the right lane of morning traffic, I fumbled for the volume knob on the stereo. I skipped a handful of Ben Harper songs, listening for something different, though I wasn\u2019t sure what. The tape flipped over, and the song that filled the car took me back to the purple-gray time of Helen\u2019s teenage depression, when she never left her room, didn\u2019t talk or eat much\u2013somewhere I hadn\u2019t been in quite a while. A heaviness sank into my shoulders and under my eyes. I felt alone again, a stark contrast to our warm infant closeness. The song carried me into the backseat of our mom\u2019s navy-blue minivan, raindrops racing to the edge of the window, losing themselves in one another, while I imagined the wild-eyed woman in the song in her white nightgown, mourning, lonely, desperate. The sadness and fear almost swallowed me, and remembering it made me drive faster, as if I could lose it in the twists and turns of Raleigh LaGrange Road.\n\n\u201cReally, we\u2019re all just lonely for ourselves,\u201d my mom said matter-of-factly, when later that day I mentioned the hollowness of that song.\n\n",

        "post_title": "Purple Eyes",
        "comment": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",

I admit that even without reason to hope, I would continue to leave the key under the mat and the front-porch light on, to listen for the sound of your car pulling into the driveway, though I would never admit this.\n\nI would habitually check the mail for your letters, which used to arrive sporadically, often conveniently on rainy days. Despite my best efforts, I would bump into you among ordinary objects: coffeepot, toothpaste, Wrangler jeans, popcorn, making my most routine days painfully full of you, yet equally empty. These would be my stumbling blocks, painting bruises up and down my shins.\n\nSometimes I lose track of you, and I am left with the confused desperation that comes when looking for a reserved seat in a dark theater. I search for your face in crowds at the airport, scouring those gathered at departure gates. Though I am constantly awaiting your arrival, you always seem to be leaving. I find it troubling how much more pronounced your departures are in my memory, as if arrivals and departures didn\u2019t come in matching pairs, like socks.\n\nWith every door that opens, I look up, half expecting to see you walking over to me, carrying my coffee just like on the winter Sundays we spent together. Slowly, I am realizing that I can\u2019t affectionately call them \u201cthe good old days\u201d because they are the exception, not the rule. Sometimes I hear myself saying, \u201cOn Sundays we used to read for hours,\u201d when it was more like, \u201cOne Sunday we read for hours.\u201d\n\nI am afraid that you\u2019ve made up your mind to go for good. You keep up the conversation just enough to fill the empty space as you awkwardly pull on your sweater, your winter scarf, hat, coat, and gloves, your bag hoisted onto one shoulder. You wait for me to show you the door, as if you are a stranger and don\u2019t know where to find it yourself. You lean in to kiss me because that is what we do when we say goodbye.\n\nI watch as you gradually coil in on yourself routinely, mechanically, like a snake tucking itself away for winter.

You stare at me with a stupid smile and rosy cheeks.\n\n\u201cYou look nice,\u201d you say.\n\nI laugh because it is how I buy time when I don\u2019t feel like forcing conversation\u2014an attempt to leave enough space for you to say something more.

        "comment": "There was a blue wool afghan draped across the back of the couch. It was slightly too small, a little scratchy, and its thick, open crochet meant any breeze could pass through undeterred. Nonetheless, it was in the constant rotation of blankets in the house\u2014somehow always a top-tier choice.\n\nOn Saturdays the girl\u2019s dad would chop wood, go for a swim, ride the bike, work on clearing his trail in the woods. Then he would lie down on the couch with the dog, both of them tired.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to close my eyes and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe girl would take off his shoes and throw the afghan over him, first sending its crocheted flowers skyward, always hoping that in this moment, the blanket would unfurl more fully, revealing an extra length that no one had noticed before, perhaps enough to cover Dad\u2019s toes.\n\nOn this particular day, her father lay there on his side, still, curled into a partial fetal position. She rarely saw him like this. Usually he was upright, poised, in action. Now he looked like the dead Christ of the Piet\u00e0, small in his humility and surrendering, small in Mary\u2019s arms, small in his limp human body.\n\nThe afghan opened midair, and she watched as it began to change form, becoming the tilma of Juan Diego, Castilian roses tumbling from its woven pattern.\n\nSuddenly she was back in grade-school gym class, grasping one small edge of a rainbow parachute. She and each of her classmates held tightly to their little patch of color, forming a circle that pulled the parachute tight, and together they rippled the fabric, throwing it into rhythm. They watched, amazed, as the parachute transformed into a stormy ocean, as it took on many forms, seamlessly.\n\nTeacher smiled, satisfied that they were sufficiently enthralled, then threw three bright-red Wiffle balls into the mix. They flew high into the air, punctuating the power of the choppy waves the students created.\n\nThe class practiced settling the parachute\u2019s waters, stirring them up again, seeing how quickly they could change the nature of its silken fabric, struggling to contain the kinetic energy that bubbled forth from their little arms and hands, as even the smallest movement rippled across the surface, traveling the expanse of the gym, escaping out the other side.\n\nThen came her favorite part. The teacher told them to throw their arms high, step under the fabric and inside, beneath the billowed sail they had created. They pulled the fabric down and behind them, and sat crossed-legged on the floor, their little bodies holding down the inside edges of the parachute.\n\nThey sat beneath its canopy, fabric pulled taut against their collective weight, understanding that they had entered another world, outside time and space, somewhere sacred, ancient, and subterranean.\n\nNo one spoke, and even the air was still. The girl made a silent vow to stay in that rosy-tinted cocoon forever, as light reflected off of each colorful segment of silk.\n\nTwenty seconds later, the parachute began its descent back to earth. It collapsed in on them, and they all crawled out from under it, laughing. She laughed too, though she felt like she had lost something important. A brief sadness rolled through her as she accepted that they could not have stayed longer.\n\nNow with the afghan, sleeping dad, and dog, she felt like she had returned to that place, and she watched as the afghan transformed before her:\n\nIt was a cloak, many-colored, impenetrable, sweat-and-blood-stained, a flag, a quilt, now woven from the silken thread of spiderwebs. It was blue and star-encrusted, its threads now embroidered with constellations, mossy green, a leaf pile, an oversize sweatshirt, the pie crust rolled out on the kitchen counter, the summer sun baking them against cast-iron asphalt. Now the afghan was blue wool again.\n\nIt was all of this, and none of it.\n\nShe waited for the collapse\u2014for the afghan to settle back into its too-small self so that she could tuck it in around sleeping dad and dog.\n\nIt began its descent, and as it fell she realized that this time, it did reach dad\u2019s toes, extending past them, spilling over them in abundance. It dripped down to the floor and unraveled before her.\n\nExcept it was not unraveling, but raveling. It expanded, seamlessly, and for a moment she understood that the universe must expand, if only to make room for this miraculous afghan blanket, which did not end, and would not end. It was in and around all things.\n\nThe afghan poured forth from the living room and into the kitchen and out the very least of the doors, the cat door, which was nothing more than a flap cut into the wall. It filled the sewer drains and horse pond out back and ran through all the creeks and up and over hills and fences, wove in and out of tree branches, and across honeysuckle vines. It did not pay attention to chain-link fences that separated hers from theirs.\n\nThe afghan flew skyward, across the breeze, surrounding the birds and becoming them. It was the sound of wind through trees and bird calls, the low hum of the leaf blower, the occasional dog bark, and it was quiet. She could not distinguish sight from sound or smell.\n\nThen she was breathing the afghan in and out and somehow she did not find it suffocating, and it was as if her lungs were thankful to hold something more solid than air, and she felt its pattern run through her.\n\nHer father was asleep and so was the dog, and she almost woke them so they could see but stopped herself.\n\nLet them sleep.\n\nShe turned the light off as she left the living room, leaving dad tucked into the couch, dimly lit by the sun that made its way through the sunroom windows.\n\nThe dog sighed, the dad was quiet, and the afghan gently draped over them. Her father woke up an hour later.\n\n\u201cIf I made coffee would you drink some?\u201d he asked.\n\n",
