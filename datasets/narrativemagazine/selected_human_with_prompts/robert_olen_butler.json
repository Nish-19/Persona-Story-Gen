de\nLangeac, Paris, 1788\n\n\n\nThomas\nthe last eight miles to my hilltop on horseback in deep snow, Patty throwing her head back to laugh, her breath pluming into the moonlight How difficult it is to come home with you, Mr. Jefferson and then the doorway is drifted high with the snow and I lift her into my arms to carry her through and the servants are asleep and the fires are out and we are home at last and I find a Chateau Latour and I start a fire and we drink and she turns her face to me My husband she says and there in our bedroom on our wedding night the firelight isn\u2019t enough to keep the night\u2019s darkness from tainting her face, like this face now, Sally\u2019s, her very blood shared with Patty, but her face darkened from within, as if through memory, as if by death, as if by my six-year grief, and Patty throws her head back at the run of her hands on the keys and I finger my strings lightly, the Bach sonata carrying us both and I am wooing still and she will say yes and we will marry and she will die, and I look into these eyes now and now and they are dark, Patty\u2019s hazel charred into deep blackness, but the shape of them is the same and I hear the Bach and I run now inside like Patty\u2019s hands running on her harpsichord I run and I run and I pursue my happiness\n\n\n\nSally\n\nso easy to come to this at last: he is playing his violin and it is very sad, the music, and I stand for a long while quiet in the doorway, behind him, his shoulders hunched forward a little, his hair\u2014I have enough of the blood of my father and my mama\u2019s father in me that I can blush in this color of his hair\u2014he bears my blush, which I see on my cheeks in the mirror with the eagle near the parlor door when I turn my face at his passing\u2014his hair catches the light from the fireplace and he draws his bow back and forth on his violin, his elbow rising and falling\u2014and I move to him and he stops playing, he knows I am behind him, and he knows how fast my heart is beating, and he ceases playing and he turns to me and his eyes are so sad and I will never as long as I live know how I come to lift my hand and put it on my master\u2019s face but I do and I am happy\n\n\nWalt Whitman, sixty-four, poet\n\nOscar Wilde, twenty-eight, poet and playwright\n\n\nIn Whitman\u2019s bedroom in his brother\u2019s house on Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey, 1883\n\n\n\nWalt\nfor this poet I sing, for this large boy, who cast off black velvet coat, cast off pink cravat, cast off white silk shirt, cast off salmon-colored stockings\u2014O thou legs of many legs! not cast off the stockings so much as carefully peeled each and shook it out and draped it so as not to make it run\u2014and he presents eyes now gray now pale blue, jaw pendulous, lips tumescent, fingers long and fondling, and he is not farmer, not ship joiner, not sawyer, not mule skinner, not coal miner or fireman or hog reeve or hawker or lamplighter\u2014perhaps lamplighter, with my lamp only, whose wick he puts to flame\u2014not butcher or cobbler or cook but poet but young but beautiful, my beard is white my skin is coarse my one arm and one leg are weak still, from their stoppage long ago, and they will stop again soon, leg and arm and belly and man-root and heart and mouth, but for now I sing\n\n\nOscar\nyour body is not electric, my captain, it is not even a steam engine, it is a wood fire in an open field\u2014I will say on Hampstead Heath, it is bad enough to think of the outdoors, so I will at least imagine your embers within the London city limits\u2014but this room of yours, my dearest Walt, if only books and newspapers and foolscap were made of porcelain and pewter and cloisonn\u00e9 you would still have a distressing jumble of an antique shop but at least one could take a breath and handle an object or two, though do not mistake me, dear old man, I am not ungrateful as I touch you\u2014every pubic inch of space is a miracle\u2014we share so much, for out in the world they speak and write of us viciously, but contempt breeds familiarity and how sad it would be to make such grand gestures as we do make and not have the wide world to witness them, though this private gesture is, for the moment, the grandest of all, my sweet barbarian, your beard smells not of trees but of book paper and we are one: I sound my nuanced yip in the parlors of the world\n\n\nMilton Berle, twenty-three, comedian\n\nAimee Semple Mcpherson, forty, evangelist\n\n\nIn her apartment in Santa Monica, after a Los Angeles charity benefit, 1930\n\n\n\nMilton\nthis is a novelty act on the Orpheum Circuit if there ever was one, the sexy Christian pastor and the good Jewish boy\u2014well, not such a good boy, though Mama looks the other way and just packs our bags when I\u2019m hosing down a girl\u2014I think sex is better than logic, but I can\u2019t prove it\u2014this is more like a freak act, not big enough to close before intermission, this, but maybe we\u2019d go on after the three-spot, presenting the Wandering Youth with the Giant Dong and Sister Aimee with the dust of the Arizona Desert from her phantom kidnapping clinging to her ankles\u2014and pretty ankles they are\u2014The sex was so good that even the neighbors had a cigarette\u2014but it\u2019s a freak act all right, with the candles burning over there on the dresser and the silver cross and the framed crucifixion\u2014don\u2019t look at me, Sister, I didn\u2019t do it\u2014A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts are feeling good\u2014all that chestnut hair of yours, smelling like the sea\u2014I\u2019d be happy to give your way a try, but It\u2019s hard to be religious when certain people have never been incinerated by a lightning bolt\u2014and you know who you are, you\u2019re not laughing right now\u2014what are you, an audience or an oil painting?\u2014maybe it\u2019s just that you know the real me, Sister, you and the silent audience both\u2014forget my baby face, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time, a long long time already, shtupping and shticking and I\u2019m starting to feel old\u2014At least I don\u2019t drink, I learned that from my Jewish mother, who never touches the stuff, alcohol interferes with her suffering\u2014Jesus may love me, but everybody else thinks I\u2019m a jerk\u2014Sure, there was a time when everybody believed in God, and the Church ruled the world, it was called the Dark Ages\u2014I believe you, Sister, Jesus is coming, but I\u2019m coming first\n\n\nAimee\nmy back bends upward and I can imagine my body turning all the colors, from my toes to the crown of my head, from red to orange to yellow and green and then to blue and indigo and to violet: I am a rainbow, I am a covenant, my Lord amen a covenant amen You put me in this body and the flesh yearns for You and You are the word made flesh and You are also the flesh made word He shall lie all night betwixt my breasts and You are present in all your creation, Lord, You are in the sparrow and You are in the beggar by the road and You are in the comedian from the vaudeville stage and with Your infinite tenderness You understood the woman at the well and You understood Your dear Mary Magdalene Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine and You understand me, who aches and thrills for You and who cries out Your love, Lord, to the world, for Your gospel is not the gospel of fear and hell and damnation but the gospel of reconciliation and of love, You move in me You fill me up, my Lord, I am full of love for even the least of Your creatures, and this one happens to have a part like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus and I hold him close so he can hear the heart in my breast which beats now madly in love of You and he will listen amen and I will soar to You amen and he will believe amen and I say amen and amen and amen\n\n\nClyde Barrow, twenty-five, outlaw\n\nBonnie Parker, twenty-three, outlaw\n\n\nIn a cabin in the woods near Shreveport, Louisiana, on the eve of their death by police ambush, 1934\n\n\n\nClyde\nsome gump I knew wanted to be a tough guy and had no chance, but I was interested in his sister who they said had slipped on the ice and broke her arm and she had it in a sling, and so I go over to the gump\u2019s house thinking to make time with the girl now that she\u2019s one arm short, and there\u2019s noise in the kitchen and I get touchy real fast because they also say the laws is looking for me \u2019cause of the little getting-started jobs I\u2019ve been pulling in McLennan County, and she says Go on in and meet my friend and there she is with her back to me, and she turns and the window is behind her and it lights up her strawberry hair like it\u2019s a fiery crown and it sure starts to burning in me right away, and the first thing I do after saying my name and she says hers is to reach into my coat pocket and pull out my pistol and lay it on the table that\u2019s between us, a 1911-model Colt .45, and this is just to make it clear to her from the first who I am and what she\u2019s getting into with me \u2019cause it don\u2019t take me more than about three seconds with this tiny girl with the red ringlets and the freckles and that smart-aleck half-smile to know she\u2019s the one, though I never dream how far she\u2019s going to go with me, but the first thing out of my mouth after we get our names and my Colt on the table is Here is my honest declaration to you, Miss Parker, I am a dangerous man to anybody who gets in the way of me taking what I want and pissing on the shoes of the government that has took everything the working stiffs have got, which also means that nobody messes with any woman who is with me and she moves that half-smile from one side of her mouth to the other, and little did I know that one day I\u2019d give her a .32-caliber Harrington and Richardson top-break pistol for her purse and her eyes would fill with grateful tears\n\n\nBonnie\nI hear a noise behind me while I\u2019m standing in Daisy Wickham\u2019s kitchen trying to open a jar of Ovaltine at the sink, and my head is full of the darnedest thick mud from the sun coming off the dirty snow outside and from the ticking of a clock and the dripping from the faucet, and I\u2019m sinking fast in that mud \u2019cause of this being what my life is\u2014making Ovaltine and hearing these sounds that ask me to just go ahead and beat my head on that window till it cracks\u2014but this noise behind me is footsteps and somehow I know it ain\u2019t Daisy, and I turn and there he is with his brown hair slicked back, though a curl of it has figured out how to drop down on his forehead, and his eyes are dark but they might as well be bright red with fire \u2019cause they are burning their way into my brain, and he says I\u2019m Clyde Barrow and I say I\u2019m Bonnie Parker and he pulls a pistol out of his coat and lays it on the table and I don\u2019t even for a second worry about a thing \u2019cause he\u2019s giving off something into the air so sweet as to make me want to wiggle my hips, but I keep real still and he says I mean to be honest with you, Miss Parker, I am a dangerous man but I am a strong man and I can get things for you so that you and me won\u2019t ever turn into working stiffs and I can take care of you forever and I don\u2019t know how long forever will be with Clyde Barrow but I am ready to say yes right then\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, twenty-four, recent graduate in philosophy from the Ecole\nNormale Superieure\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, twenty-one, recent graduate in philosophy from the Sorbonne\n\n\nIn her fifth-floor rented room at 91 Avenue Denfert-Rochereau, Montparnasse, Paris, 1929\n\n\n\nJean-Paul\ntoo much of her too much silk skin, brick nipple, face of porcelain, too much of this room too much cane chair and claw-foot table and orange divan too much orange-papered wall and foxed window shade, too much caf\u00e9 still clinging like the smell of pipe smoke to us in too much wood-plank bed too much stack of cafe saucer, too much mirror showing mirror showing mirror too much gilt frame, too much sheep-back hunching of bodies all around, too much night street after the caf\u00e9 too much plane tree and shadow of plane tree on the cobbled street too much hooded lamp and boulder row of Renault, too much stairway and crystal of bare lightbulbs and shadow down the hall and hard brass doorknobs, all of it too much, all of it with no reason for being there, too much gape of her lips, too much gape of her loins, too much of her and too little of me: I think I\u2019m going to be sick\n\n\nSimone\none eye dead, one eye drifts away, neither of them looking at me, and I thrash in the vague light on the crumpled sheet not from his touch but from his sightlessness: I have vanished and my invisibility shudders through me like sex and I can hear him thinking inside that wall-eyed head sitting on that tiny body with its tiny parts and he knows me not, but he knows he knows me not, and I know he knows he knows me not, and so I am even more alone in this bed in this room in this shuddering trembling body of mine and I am free.\n",
