        "comment": "1.\nThe problem with my mother is that she thinks everyone a fool, even me. Especially me. Perhaps I too am part of the problem. I know my role, and I play it well, even when I don\u2019t want to. Take last Friday, when we were at the market, and she wouldn\u2019t stop bargaining with the man about the price of some used sandals I was sure had only a few more wears in them before their straps gave up and fell off. She knew it too but somehow was insistent on getting them, which made her determination all the more frustrating. She was going to get what she wanted, at any cost, because, well, the stuff is worthless as it is, and the seller could just as well hand it to her for free, because who else would waste fifty cedis on some loose and battered leather? She said this, even as she crouched to try on the pair, her hand holding on to me for balance.\n\nBefore we walked away with the sandals tucked into her bag, she had painted a picture of a family I didn\u2019t recognize: my father had been arrested many times, and he wouldn\u2019t stop drinking; I had been down with malaria and admitted to the hospital for weeks, and that day in the market was the first time I was able to stand without any help; she, my mother, had no money on her except for fifty cedis, and if the man took all of it, how would we get home? Can a sick child walk all the way in this depressing heat, and what if I collapsed? The man, who by then wasn\u2019t sure what to believe, looked at me, and then at my mother, and at last settled his curious eyes on me again. There was no need to say it; whatever was going to happen next was all up to me. I could either protest and call the woman a liar or be my mother\u2019s daughter. Without giving it any further thought, I felt the crumpling of my face and some new desperation stinging my eyes. I was suddenly weak in the knees; my shoulder began to twitch, and the quiver in my lips followed. Right before the shoe vendor, I was becoming the sick child my mother had made up, and I knew I would have started to cry had he not distrusted his own senses and given us the sandals, had he not believed this act to free me from this shamelessly orchestrated moment, from my self-pity, from this shadow of a mother and what was slowly starting to feel like bitterness against her. Rage too.\n\nI have always wanted to wrench myself free from whatever hold my mother has on me. But she is in my head, and under my skin, and sometimes, even tugging at my heart as one would a puppet. It is how it has always been: I do what I am told and what is expected of me\u2014I do not think; I do not ask. Some days I am invisible too; she can\u2019t strike me when she can\u2019t see me. I stay small and compliant. After all, to rebel would mean to know better than my mother, and how can I when I barely know myself?\n\n\n2.\nMy mother doesn\u2019t go to the man alone; she takes me along. We go most Saturdays after we\u2019ve sold all our mangoes at the market. There\u2019s always a bag she saves for him. Today I am the one carrying the bag, and so when we walk into his house, I don\u2019t know whether to place it on the table in the kitchen, or give it to him like a gift, or simply stand there holding it, becoming one with the offering. When he sees us, he rises from his desk and heads straight for me. I imagine my mother standing behind me, nodding, smiling, egging him on. I feel their gaze on me, and it is its own kind of coldness. The man makes as if to squat, reaches for my chin, tilts my face to meet his eyes, and says, \u201cNow, how did I get so lucky? Thank you, princess.\u201d When he takes the bag from me, I notice his eyes are still on me, and before I can catch the lopsided smile that I know is breaking across his face, he steps back and it becomes only my mother in the space again. I am not there. Or they forget that I am. Sometimes even I forget that I am here, in this body. They leave me in the kitchen and head for the room, and I see the man\u2019s hand already wrapping around my mother\u2019s waist, tickling her. I am supposed to believe they are working together. Ma said he writes for the newspaper and, well, she likes to read. I tell myself maybe they are going over his lines; maybe he\u2019s interviewing Ma about the last flood that swept so much of the sellers\u2019 fresh produce away. I stand there and watch the clock. The house is quiet, and I can hear them move. I hear Ma\u2019s laughter and all the other sounds she makes. I sit and stare at my hands, which are still heavy from the weight of mangoes that have long been taken away from me.\n\nAny good child would say something, but I don\u2019t. My father, who spends all day at his mechanic shop, comes home to a bucket of cold water filled to the brim for his bath, his dinner set on the table, and my mother, all sweet and chirpy\u2014she sits next to him, she watches him while he eats, and although it is under the table and out of my view, I know she traces her hand along his thigh, and grips him. Sometimes she looks right at me while my father stiffens in the chair and avoids my eyes; I wonder if she knows that I know. I want to ask if she sees me, if she\u2019s threatened by me, and if she cares.\n\nIf anyone wonders, this is why I show up at the man\u2019s place after school: because I already know the answers to all these questions that I never dare ask her. It is a Wednesday, and I don\u2019t expect to find him there, but that doesn\u2019t stop me. I must see him. I do not understand the urgency, or maybe I do and I\u2019m too afraid to admit it. When he finds me at the door, he doesn\u2019t look surprised and doesn\u2019t ask why I\u2019m there. It is as if he\u2019s expecting me. My princess. He stretches his hand and I take it as he leads me inside.\n\nWhat the townspeople have said about my mother is that she was a wild child, whatever that means. It\u2019s not something they try to hide from me. While other eleven-year-olds are teased for who they like, I\u2019m mocked because my mother \u201cwas something wild.\u201d I don\u2019t think the people at school even know what that means, and neither did I until I heard her friends at the market talking about Ma: She couldn\u2019t stay in one place for too long, and there was no stopping her; there are stories about her from the brothel in the next town; it is so good how her life\u2019s turned around now that a man\u2019s pinned her down.\n\nThis is precisely what the journalist does after he guides me through his kitchen and ushers us into the same room my mother walked into\u2014pins me down. I know what is about to happen. I\u2019ve seen it in films. I have seen my mother too, with my father, when they forget I\u2019m home and leave the door open a crack. Although I don\u2019t want to be caught, it\u2019s never felt intrusive either. Probably because sometimes I\u2019m convinced that Ma wants me to see, needs me to step into her world and learn its songs but never actually dance to its tune until it\u2019s time.\n\nI decide today that it is time.\n\n\n3.\nThe journalist is careful and tender. He doesn\u2019t rip off my skirt or fumble with the buttons of my blouse in haste, like I expect. He takes his time and for some reason, doesn\u2019t feel the need to look away. He holds me in his glance while his hands work, and I can\u2019t tell if the look in his eyes is curiosity or wonder, or both. My princess. His voice in my ear is the sweetest song, and I want him to keep calling me his. To make clear the kind of possession that ties me to something sturdy and capable. I\u2019m surprised by his strength and at the same time startled by my own smallness, this meek frame against the weight of a man, the weight of a world that persists in its acts of quiet violence. I don\u2019t care. All I know is I don\u2019t want him to stop seeing me. I don\u2019t want him to stop doing what he\u2019s doing to my body. It is strangely painful, and yet I open myself up for more. I\u2019m ashamed because I forget all I had rehearsed to tell him. I want you to do to me what you do to my mother. I want to laugh and make the sounds she makes with you. And I want to be more than she is, more than she will ever be.\n\nWhen it\u2019s done, he takes me to the shower and moves a wet sponge down my back. My legs are sore, and I rest my head against the tile. I am in this body, but also away from it. It\u2019s after he makes me a sandwich and watches me eat that I find my voice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your name,\u201d I say very matter-of-factly. He smiles. He doesn\u2019t look as old as my father and he\u2019s not young either. I stare at his thick eyebrows, the dimple in his cheek when he smiles, his rough hands that have been in soft places. I turn to look at the door to the room, which holds the unspeakable weight of what I\u2019ve done, and quickly look away. Something is lodged in my chest\u2014I don\u2019t know what to call it, or how to rip it out.\n\n\u201cBut I know yours.\u201d He reaches for my hand from across the table. \u201cYou\u2019re Rose, like the flower.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the flower,\u201d I repeat, taking a big bite of the sandwich. I\u2019m famished and tired. I want to be scooped up and tucked into bed. I\u2019m waiting for him to tell me not to say a word about this, but instead he says my parents are going to be looking for me, aren\u2019t they? The thought scares me too, although I quickly realize that I do want them to come looking for me, I do want them to feel dread at the thought of losing me. If I\u2019m being honest, what I really want is for my mother to know what I\u2019ve done, and how I, her little thing, am capable of taking what she hides in the dark and making it mine. Before I leave, he plants a kiss on my head and says, \u201cWill you come again? Please come again.\u201d I sense it right away, his wanting, and I feel it twisting me something furious. It\u2019s not at all what I imagined.\n\nAs I head for the door, I catch a glimpse of the mangoes we brought to him. He\u2019s placed them in a bowl in the kitchen, and because they were all so ripe, they\u2019re starting to bruise, moldy dark spots forming on their skin. He will throw them all out, and the next time he sees me, I\u2019ll be with my mother, who comes bearing more gifts than any man has need for.\n",

        "comment": "He has his hands on Nii\u2019s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They\u2019re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he\u2019ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother\u2019s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo\u2014that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. \u201cHow is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?\u201d they\u2019ll say to one another. \u201cThe baby must have sucked out her last breath.\u201d Sometimes they\u2019ll curse and plead their favor, \u201cChai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.\u201d And hence the banishment of my family.\n\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I\u2019ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy\u2019s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn\u2019t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn\u2019t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\n\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother\u2019s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, \u201cYou sound just like Ma. It is comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\n\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\n\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby\u2019s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn\u2019t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn\u2019t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I\u2019m sure no one will pay for a womb\u2019s curse. I know I\u2019ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles\u2014leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers\u2019 lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\n\nWe\u2019ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I\u2019ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It\u2019s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I\u2019ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.\n\nAnyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many things\u2014Mother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Joseph\u2019s hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing. Nii stirs slightly, awakened by the noise, and I stretch my arm to pat him on the back, hushing him and whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, now, just a bad dream.\u201d I know when the war ends because the crying stops, and a strange calmness settles over me. Trembling, I open my eyes, and the sky, an empty, borderless page, looks down at me, and I dare God to finally speak.\n",

        "comment": "They will cut your stomach open like a fruit, Emefa says to Chichi as they walk back home from the river, their pots balanced on their heads. The women in the village of Atebubu are going mad over the news\u2014Chichi, daughter of Awo, has decided to give birth in the clinic in the city and, what\u2019s worse, undergo some kind of surgery, one where the baby does not come from between her legs. Chichi\u2019s mother, a popular plantain seller, faces a tough time at the local market. The women disperse their small gatherings when they see her approaching, and some will not even look her in the eye. The rumors spread fast, a few of the stories surprising Awo upon hearing\u2014Chichi has ridiculed the traditional method of childbirth and called the town\u2019s midwives ignorant, their tools unsterile. She\u2019s using all of her life\u2019s savings for this surgery when she could afford five plots of land for farming. Others even cursed her daughter\u2019s womb, saying, Nothing good will come from there, that child will be no better than any of ours.\n\nShe knows they blame her for this, as if anyone can ever make Chichi change her mind. She remembers the day her daughter spoke about it for the first time. She was only two months pregnant.\n\nMa?\n\nEh?\n\nHow painful is childbirth? Chichi let the words out so easily, as though she were talking about the weather. These topics are considered sacred, and Awo, who was breaking off stalks in a bowl filled with red pepper, stopped abruptly and looked at her daughter before continuing her work. They sat in silence for a while. Chichi hummed an old tune in patience, knowing her mother was giving the question some thought, perhaps too much of it. And when her mother finally spoke, she said, As painful as death. I won\u2019t lie to you, Chi. I\u2019ve never been dead before but while I gave birth to you, I imagined this is how dying feels like\u2014breaking away from your body while still in it.\n\nAwo had had a difficult pregnancy. She was bedridden for months, and people said she nearly didn\u2019t recover. After that, she spat on the floor and swore to never bear a child again and never had since. There were days she worried her daughter had inherited her fear, traumatized by her painful labor.\n\nBut, she added, it ends, you don\u2019t think the pain ever stops but it does. And you open your eyes and there\u2019s a new life nestled in your arms. One of the best gifts, look at you now. Awo stood up then, her back to Chichi as she half smiled at her daughter\u2019s curiosity, all the while the ache of the unknown tugging at her heart.\n\n\nEverything Chichi knows she\u2019s read in books. While her friends crowd the only home in the village with a television set, she spends her days after work inside a library, an old tumbledown cottage with its shelves weathered and dusty, loaded with donated books, several of them with pages missing or ripped out. When she discovered she was going to be a mother, she pulled off the shelf every book that had on its cover something to do with pregnancy\u2014Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting, Foods for Nine Whole Months, often showing the smiling face of a white woman with her protruding belly. It was in one of these books that Chichi came across the C-section. She saw in the illustration how an incision is made in the abdomen and the baby removed. She moved her fingers over the page, marveled at how easy and simple it looked, nothing like the horrific things she had been told.\n\nShe had never said a word about her fear of childbirth, since it would come across as absurd. What kind of woman is terrified by her own power? But she was scared about the thought of a full body popping out from between her legs. She was sickened by it, afraid for her dear life. Which is why with the book in her hands, Chichi had run home to show her mother this miracle she had found. But Awo, upon seeing the pictures, broke down in tears, shaking fervently. She ordered Chichi to return the book to the library or watch it burned on the coal pot. This is an abomination. I have never seen something like this before. The body is not meat that it should be cut. Hei! Chichi Attawura, do not bring me trouble.\n\nOf course there was no stopping Chichi. She would bring the trouble on her household, break their necks with its burden and console them with the joys of her newborn child.\n\nHer mother was not the only one who had shared her painful birth story; her friends spoke about it often and described how herbs were inserted in their private parts to cleanse the unborn baby and how they were made to gobble down bitter concoctions. What terrified her most was hearing about how the newborn\u2019s head was molded over a lit fire, a practice meant to shape the child\u2019s head into a pleasing round figure. Kids with large foreheads and square-shaped heads were often made fun of, teased for not having enough fire down their skulls. After the child was born, the cord was cut with a reed, and cow-dung powder was mixed with mud and applied to quicken the healing. Not every part of the story was hideous\u2014during the birth, old women, most of whom had never been to school but had delivered hundreds of babies, gathered around the labor hut and sang war songs until the cry of a child was heard from the inside. Her mother had once said, It\u2019s like going to war. You fight and fight and lose some blood. But if you\u2019re lucky, you return whole, along with a gift you salvaged from the battleground.\n\nBut not Chichi. There was no way her child was simply something to be salvaged. This was her baby, her heart, and, even more than she would like to admit, her proof of survival after her lover of four years left in the middle of the night, having been told the day before by a beaming Chichi that he was going to be a father. This birth, carried out in the safe way she\u2019d seen in the books, would be the only thing that would make sense in her life.\n\n\nOn a cold August night Awo heard her daughter scream. Lying next to her with the roof of her belly swollen, Chichi bit her lower lip, wincing in pain. The mat was soaked wet. That\u2019s when Awo knew it was time. Finally this child would be born in whatever way the mother wished and would be the talk of town for about a month or so until the townspeople found another story to rub their mouths in. She rose from the mat and helped her daughter to her feet. Chichi, overcome by an unhinging sensation, could barely keep still. It wasn\u2019t until Awo washed her face at the tap that she realized it was stark midnight and not a vehicle in sight. There was no way a truck would be moving to the city at this time. She panicked at the thought, unsure what her daughter would decide to do next.\n\nI\u2019ll go on an okada, Chichi said, rubbing her palms hurriedly against her cheeks, anything to get her mind off the contractions.\n\nAn okada? Awo gasped. Chi, have you seen yourself? You\u2019re as huge as an oak tree and here you are, talking about riding on an okada. Please, listen to me. The local nurses are a few huts away. All we have to do is go to them, and this baby will be out. Sharp sharp.\n\nNo. Chichi\u2019s voice was firm, in no way swayed by her discomfort. She shook her head, her mind already filling with the odor of cow dung and rusted metals.\n\nAwo needed no one to tell her about how adamant her daughter could be. Wrapping a cloth over her waist, she set off to the market and headed to the transport shed, where okada riders waited their turn for passengers. A lean man lay on a bench asleep, his helmet clutched tight to his chest as though if he had to guard against anything, that would be a good enough weapon to save him. Awo rushed to his side, panting. She shook him by the arm and said, Chief, I need you. Hurry. My daughter is in labor. The man, still waking up from his sleep, was startled by the sight of a woman in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes and threw his legs over the bench, stretching. He registered the urgency in Awo\u2019s voice and without a word got on his motorbike. Awo joined him at the back, and he sped off, the smoke from his pipe coughing out like a long-held secret.\n\nThey found Chichi on the cement floor, moaning, letting out huge breaths. The rider, who clearly felt he was in the wrong place, stared from one face to the other as he pointed to the labor hut, a few huts away from them, and asked, Ah, is this where she\u2019s going? He was unable to hide his frustration for coming all the way just to cover such a short distance.\n\nNo, Awo said, as she helped Chichi up. She\u2019s going to the clinic in the city. The rider, who by this time thought he was dreaming, stood by his bike without moving, resting his eyes on both women. Not until Chichi let out a painful scream did he shake himself out of the trance and assist her onto the bike. On the back of the okada Chichi looked as though she would fall and roll onto her stomach any moment. The rider, after having decided to leave the two women to their fate, stretched out his hand for the fare, and Awo folded a twenty cedis note into his palm. He sped off. As Awo wandered back into the hut, the bloated body of her daughter bumping down the dusty road was the last image clouding her mind.\n\n\nAwo was not the first to arrive at the clinic. After sitting on a truckload of pineapples for three hours, she found her daughter\u2019s friends in the waiting area and immediately knew something was wrong. They ran to Awo and clad her in an uncomfortable embrace. She was impatient and stopped herself from asking the question tingling on her tongue: Which one of them survived? As though certain only one had to go, as though the loss of one life makes up for the other. Her legs trembled, but she leaned against a wall as she searched their eyes for answers. It\u2019s the baby, she said, knowing immediately. She watched them nod, a calm relief unknotting inside her. She didn\u2019t cry but asked to see her daughter. A fetal injury, they had been told. In the making of the uterine incision, a laceration was accidentally made to the baby\u2019s head. The cut was long and deep on the baby\u2019s scalp, and the baby died after an hour of hemorrhaging.\n\nChichi lay with her back flat on the bed, her head turned to face the other side of the room. The only sound, apart from her muffled cries, was from a small ceiling fan that spun slowly above their heads. The room was neat, and on a table was a bowl of untouched soup. A wooden chair sat next to the bed. Fancy place, Awo thought as she walked toward Chichi. Chi, she said softly and saw her daughter try to inch her body farther away, a movement that sent pain searing through her body. It was only a small bed but it seemed an ocean between them. Awo moved around to face her daughter and sat on the floor, hoping the nurses wouldn\u2019t think her insane. She reached for her daughter\u2019s hand as she spoke. Chi, my child, you have fought a good fight.\n\nChichi was quiet, her tears spilling heavily onto the white sheets. She didn\u2019t want a good fight. She didn\u2019t want any fight at all. Her body was numb and yet a throng of pain moved through her. Her mind flooded with thoughts. The most horrifying was returning to Atebubu without a child. Walking back empty-handed, having nothing to show, nothing to prove. And the word that would go around about how her library mind had failed her. Awo thought about the same things too, sitting on the cold floor, watching her daughter grieve.\n\nSilence, a weapon of choice, hung between them, cut through the air. How quickly loss takes over the body and inhabits it. Awo couldn\u2019t tell what would have been worse\u2014the baby surviving and the family having to live with the curse of a child born in an unnatural way or having to carry the burden of loss and shame. And as if giving up on understanding the dilemma, she thought, What does it matter even? That which is gone is gone forever. We shall rub this sore to heal. After all, a scar is nothing but a blemish. The body can take it, the body can take it, she whispered more to herself than to Chichi. Both mother and daughter wept then, emptying themselves of an unspoken heaviness and cleaning their wounds dry, like a hungry tongue scraping the bottom of a pot.\n",
        "writing_prompt": "In a village where tradition governs every aspect of life, Chichi defies the norms by choosing a modern, controversial method of childbirth. When tragedy strikes, she and her mother must navigate the weight of loss, shame, and the whispers of a community unwilling to understand."

        "comment": "Kids my age have questions about the most mundane things\u2014how far is the sky from our heads? And when we stretch our hands high enough, can we reach it? First I wanted to be a pilot, but now I am convinced I\u2019ll grow up to become a nurse and nothing else. I spend my days putting pills into categories based on their colors and I already know words like dementia, seizure, and disorientation. I know exactly what to do when Papa has a seizure in the middle of the night and Mother is at the pub with her singer friends or at the police station for drunk driving. Or at another man\u2019s house. It\u2019s always a struggle at the start but I manage to loosen his shirt and turn him on his side to keep his airway clear. And then I grab a jacket from the back of the door and fold it under his head.\n\nToday I\u2019m making soup for Papa, as I stand on a stool and squint to read the recipe in mother\u2019s crabbed handwriting. Onions, cloves of chopped garlic, and dandelion leaves\u2014the only meal Papa will eat without throwing up. Through the window, I see friends from school playing outside. They\u2019re running around a burst pipe, soaking themselves wet. In this game, the one who wins is the boy who gets the least soaked by the sprinkling. There are days we\u2019d run around the neighborhood digging in the dirt, searching for loose pipes we can burst with stones. Such a stupid game, and yet I hate that I\u2019m stuck inside this kitchen stirring a pot of soup.\n\nLike I\u2019ve been taught, I fetch two ladles of soup into a bone-china bowl my parents received on their fifth anniversary and walk down the hall imagining the gold-painted brushes designed on the bowl turning into tiny snakes. In my head, they slither into the pool of soup and float on the surface.\n\nI walk into Papa\u2019s room, which is also now my room, and set the bowl on his bedside. I haven\u2019t slept in my bed in six months. The room has changed so much since Papa\u2019s illness. The floor, made of hard, unpolished wood, has light stains from Papa\u2019s vomit, and a carpet sits rolled to the far end of the room. Mother says, \u201cWe\u2019ll roll this back when your father gets well,\u201d and every time I wonder if she means it. I walk toward the bed and see that Papa\u2019s eyes are still closed. I know he\u2019s waiting for me to cup his cheeks in my hands, and so I do. This used to be my favorite part of the day\u2014watching him open his eyes to me, for me. Papa would always tell me, \u201cKanea a w\u2019ani di kan tua no na ehia.\u201d It matters the first light you see.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s my big boy doing?\u201d His weak voice fills my ears and I try not to look away.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI made you soup and the boys are playing outside.\u201d\n\nHis eyes grow wild in shock, as they always do when I tell him about all the things I\u2019m missing by staying at home.\n\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here? Little boys belong outside. Playing and running. Chasing after what they\u2019re chasing after.\u201d\n\nThis is the same response he gives me every time, and I know it by heart. I help him sit up on the hard bed and I bring a full spoon to his lips. \u201cEat, Papa.\u201d He opens his mouth slightly to be fed.\n\nThere are days I want my first light to be a gush of fresh water from a broken pipe, win or lose. I have thought many times of leaving the soup on the stove to burn and watching the snakes drown in the heat. More than once I have wanted to stand at the door and watch, doing nothing, while Papa\u2019s seizure shakes the room. As for Mother, I think about rolling her up in her lavish carpet, never to see her again. But I don\u2019t run. Perhaps because I have more fear than courage or an equal measure of both to keep me in this room, cleaning my Papa\u2019s body with a wet towel, drying foam from the edges of his mouth, and saying a different name every time he looks at me and goes, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n",
