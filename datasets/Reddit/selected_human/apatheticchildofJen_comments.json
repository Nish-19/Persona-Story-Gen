Upon arriving, you find that they're in the middle of an existential crisis; they can't remember how to turn back into their original, human form.",
        "comment": "I practically kick the door down, scared my friend\u2019s finally been captured by the government. I barely have time to breath a sigh of relief before the panic comes back at the sight of my friend having a panic attack on the floor, in the form of a parrot. Which might be comical in another circumstance.\n\nImmediately I\u2019m by his side, picking him up and wrapping my hands around him, attempting to be comforting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d I tell the parrot, \u201cyou\u2019re ok. Just breath. With me, come on. In for 4, hold for 7, out for 8,\u201d I instruct quickly. \u201cBreath in 2 3 4. Hold your breath 2 3 4 5 6 7. Breath out 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. 1 2 3 4. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.\u201d My friend starts to copy my breathing, getting control enough to start speaking.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cSshh, it\u2019s ok. Let\u2019s calm down first. Can you tell me 5 things you can see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d the squeaky parrot voice managed through gasps. \u201cWindow, wall,\u201d he continued, \u201cfloor, roof.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good,\u201d I said, keeping my voice steady and calm, \u201cnow 4 things you can hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, me, car, radiator,\u201d my friend responded, the breaths sounding more controlled.\n\n\u201cNow 3 things you can feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. Feathers.\u201d\n\n\u201c2 things you can smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. Bleach.\u201d I nod to him, smiling\n\n\u201cAnd one thing you can taste.\u201d I see something almost like mischief in the parrots eyes as it licks me. I let go quickly and the parrot flies onto my knee, laughing.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d\n\nI chuckle along with it. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d My friend nodded, so I continue. \u201cSo what\u2019s up? What happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember me. I can\u2019t remember how to turn back.\u201d\n\nI frown. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember who I am. Where I end and the animals begin.\u201d\n\nI lift my friend up close to me. \u201cYou need a picture?\u201d\n\nMy friend shakes his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t connect with my human form. What if\u2026 I\u2019m just not human enough anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t connect with who you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much has changed. New house, new job, my\u2026 mother. What if I\u2019m not the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne minute.\u201d I run up his stairs, running back down a couple minutes later with a photo album.\n\n\u201cI said that didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBear with me,\u201d I tell him before opening at the first page, him in his mother\u2019s arms for the first time a week after his birth. \u201cYou remember your birth story? Your mother had to walk 2 hours from her hike to the nearest hospital. You were dangerously premature so were immediately c-sectioned. Your mum didn\u2019t even get to see you \u2018till the next day and couldn\u2019t hold you a week after that. They didn\u2019t take picture of you until that point because they said they\u2019d remember every second of that well enough that they wouldn\u2019t need a photo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that story, it\u2019s my own birth.\u201d\n\nI ignored him and kept talking, flipping a couple pages to him right after learning to walk at his dad\u2019s funeral. \u201cAnd your father died before you knew him. Killed in a hit and run. You were too young to understand, they had to close the casket because you kept trying to climb in with him. You then complained, worried he would be unhappy when he woke up as they buried them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for the reminder.\u201d\n\nI turned to when he was four, the first photo of the two of us. \u201cWhen we first met you were pretending to be a snake in the sand pit and we started playing. My mother was horrified, so you turned back to comfort her. Did not work. Took her 2 years to finally become comfortable around you. And you got grounded for revealing your secret so easily.\u201d I look to another photo on the same page of my friend in a tuxedo. \u201cAnd your mum got married to Dave. Wonderful guy. Took you a while to accept him. You finally when he played with you unknowingly while you were a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know all this. You\u2019re just telling me my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur first day at school was crazy. We were sat on opposite sides of the class so you\u2019d \u2019go to the toilet\u2019 then sneak back in as a bug to spend time with me. The teachers had your parents take you to the doctors to get your bowels checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for bringing up that embarrassing memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour 6th birthday remains the best birthday party ever. Dave tried to bake a cake. It ended up the ugliest thing in the world but best tasting cake. We went to a water park with everyone in our class. You turned into a fish to scare and gaslight the other kids. We tricked Adam into thinking you were a mermaid,\u201d I chuckled at the memory and so did my friend.\n\n\u201cYou in high school was so cringy. You were trying to be edgy so hard and failed.\u201d I turned to a photo of him with a black wig that was worn very badly and rather hideous black clothes with 2 badges on and that\u2019s all. \u201cWhile you did that I became the teachers\u2019 favourite student and everyone was so surprised we were friends, but I got you out of so much trouble by vouching for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried to start a board games club together. Only one other guy showed up and he turned out to be an incel. So it was just us, playing board games every Monday. I always looked forward to that day. Everyone thought I was weird for loving Monday, but it was because I got to play with you. Then we immediately joined the board games club in college. And that was a disaster. We were both the worst in the club, competed for not getting last place. Remember that time we teamed up against one guy in risk and we still lost?\u201d My friend nods.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is to remind you. You were not the same person throughout all that, you were mischievous as a child, wannabe edgy in high school and we were both finally discovering ourselves in college. And then Uni we were apart except for the holidays but you did change, became more confident and sure of yourself. But every time, despite changing, you were still able to shapeshift. It\u2019s not about if you\u2019d changed, because you\u2019ve always been changing. You forgot who you are but let me remind you. You are kind and mischievous and silly. You often present a false appearance to the outside world in more than just your shapeshifting, especially with strangers, but in company you are the most genuine and confident person I know. You are who you are now, but if you don\u2019t know who that is, you are also the result of everything you were. Remember who you were, everything you were and keep moving forward through the years and you\u2019ll remember who you are.\u201d\n\nMy friend takes a deep breath and starts to change. I quickly put him down and back away as my friend is standing in front of me agajn",

        "post_title": "[WP] The prophecy foretold that The Great Evil would awaken 1000 years after his original defeat. As it turns out, the people took this very seriously, so when he awakened, he was met with an army of blessed knights, an evil containment system, and two dozen automated holy turrets aimed at him.",
        "comment": "Now, you may think this is weird, right? I mean, humans taking a threat in the far future seriously enough to not only keep the story alive for the entire thousand years, but to also temporarily unite under a single banner to amass a military capable of stopping the Great Evil\u2019s rise? That\u2019s practically unheard of. But there was one major factor here. That prophecy wasn\u2019t the only one. It was part of a book of a thousand prophecies. One prophecy every year until the Great Evil rose. So naturally, when the kingdoms realised the 100% accuracy of the prophecies, which took an embarrassingly long time, they started preparing for each prophecy as they came, hoping to use each on to their full advantage, or suffer as little as possible from each prophecy. And then over the thousand years it just became tradition, preparing for each prophecy. So preparing for this prophecy was just par for the course.\n\nI joined the military when most people did, as my kingdom started the draft in preparation. We were some of the first to start preparing, so the other kingdoms had to catch up. Then it became a race to get the magic, technology and resources to defeat the great evil. It didn\u2019t much effect me, I just trained with my lance and shield all day, every day, for about 3 years. When the day came, we marched on the mountain. Almost 100,000 men, mages and engineers. Fortresses, trenched and siege equipment were prepped and we stood in lines, side by side with soldiers who, on any other day, would be our enemy.\n\nAnd now here I am, looking at the huge metal door that, over the thousand years, had been slowly rusting away. Despite our preparations, nervousness is still apparent in the entire line. With each bang of the thing trying to get out, the line shifts and nobles call out to keep us in formation. Large cracks start to form across the door as I hear the holy turrets charge up. The holy knights in reserve and on our flanks make clanking noises as they stretch and warm up.\n\nFinally, with one last crash, the doors come tumbling down and the Great Evil emerges.\n\nIt is difficult to describe the look on its face, as the beast is more of a huge shadowy cloud rather than possessing any recognisable features. But if I were to name it, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s surprise.\nThe holy turrets open fire on the beast, drawing its attention as the armies of evil pour out of the door and through its legs.\n\nThe nobles and knights around us shout commands.\n\n\u201cPRESENT ARMS! ADVANCE!\u201d I repeat the commands, sending it down the line as I move to meet the horde.\n\nThe horde charges with no semblance of order, resulting in the first wave practically impaling themselves upon our lances and spears and the following waves being vulnerable from the sides. Blood splatters across my shield as I stab forward again and again, leaving a pile of bodies in front of us. We try to keep advancing, but the Great Evil has other plans. Between volleys from the holy turrets, catapults and ballistas, it swings at our lines, carving large holes in them. Holy knights move in to plug the gaps as the horde attempts to break through.\n\nThe more of the horde we kill, the more bodies pile up, making me stumble as we attempt to fight our way forwards.\nBefore I even know what\u2019s happened, a huge black cloud crashes through our ranks, sending me stumbling to the floor. The Great Evil\u2019s foot was right where I had once been, blocking the Holy knights from plugging the gap and leaving us scattered soldiers alone with the horde. I ditch my lance for the more manoeuvrable club and start fighting for my life. I battle my way through the horde, meeting up with a few spearmen and others like me, using shields and clubs. Together we form our own mini line, facing the horde as one. Despite being surrounded, we fight off the disorganised horde, backing up to rejoin the battle line on either side of the Great Evil\u2019s foot.\n\nA series of loud explosions ring out and a dark cloud passes over us. Just in time we dive out the way, though not all of us made it. The Great Evil stumbles back as holy knights rush to fill the gap in the line and assist those like us, trapped in front. A huge knight, like almost 7 foot and biceps as big as my head, runs up to us. She picks us up and straightens us out shouting over the din of the battle. \u201cWITH ME!\u201d We move with her, back towards the lines of holy knights as other scattered soldiers rally to us, by the time we rejoin the line, almost a hundred of us had rallied and the holy knights expertly rearrange their formation to fit us in.\n\nThen a call comes down the line. \u201cADVANCE!\u201d I repeat the call and start moving with my comrades, cutting down thousands of evil forces as we move forward, the Great Evil struggling under the pummelling of the holy turrets, catapults etc.\n\nFinally, the beast falls to the ground. The 5 mages destined to finally slay the Great Evil run forward and we move to cover them.\n\nOne particularly huge soldier charges towards our line. The archers attempt to fell the beast, but to know avail as it crashes straight into our line, impaling itself on our spears and lances but not falling. It throws me across the battlefield and I fall unconscious.\n\n\nI shoot up, looking around me for danger. I\u2019m in a large white tent, beds lining each side full of other people. Many are wearing bandages, like one I realise I have around my head. I teach up and touch to side of my head, hissing in pain. A nurse walks in and smiles.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake. How\u2019re you feeling?\u201d\n\nI shrug. \u201cFine, I think. What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got thrown by a troll. Most people that happens to are unconscious at least a week, you wear only a couple days.\u201d\n\n\u201cLucky me,\u201d I mutter. \u201cWhat about the battle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we won that. As you might be able to tell from the fact we aren\u2019t dead. The chosen 5 killed the evil and the united armies slaughtered the army of the damned. Now everything can go back to as it was before.\u201d\n\nI slump back in my bed. \u2018As it was before.\u2019\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the kingdoms are still rivals?\u201d\n\nThe nurse shrugs as she walks out.\nThe army starts moving out a few days later and, by the time we make it home a few days after that, I\u2019ve been discharged by the medics. I immediately return home to my farm, thanking the stars that I am alive and embracing my wife and child.",

Now, years later, there\u2019s a knock on your door, and you find yourself face-to-face with a group of superpowered teenagers claiming you\u2019re their father.",
        "comment": "$30 million for my DNA? Of course I took that deal. I could put just $2 million in the bank and live off the interest, $30 million would set me up for life, and my children, and my children\u2019s children and, if we invested smartly, they\u2019re children too. You may think that was crazy and really shady, which was my thought too, but it was all legit. The doctor was genuine, the contract official and the government agent who greeted me too. They said I appeared to be the \u201cideal subject\u201d for their experiments. So a blood donation, cheek swab and\u2026 ahem other donation later and I was $30 million richer, well actually they gave me quite a bit more. Went back to Britain and lived my life normally, well I did once I explained to the fraud investigators where I\u2019d got the money from and paid my taxes for the massive income, putting me down to exactly $30 million or \u00a323,653,350.\n\nI hired a financial advisor and invested the money smartly. I paid off the mortgage, my student debt and the huge list of other debts I had to pay, barely made a dent. Then I got the teaching job I\u2019d always wanted. Money was no longer an issue, I simply took some of the interest of my investments and used it to supplement my income. Life was good, didn\u2019t really tell anyone about my good fortune, but close friends and family always got good gifts on birthdays and Christmas. I found a wife, got a couple of children, biological and adopted. I\u2019d say I almost forgot the incident, but it\u2019s hard to forgot the thing that is funding your lifestyle.\n\nAbout 20 years passed before the consequences showed up at my front door, literally and figuratively. I was home sick with a bug I\u2019m pretty sure my daughters brought home and waiting for the microwave to finish with my soup when a knock on the door sounded through the house. Despite having no reason to, I had a bad feeling about it, so bad I ended up picking up one of the kitchen knives as I made my way to the door, opening the door just a crack, bracing it against my foot and peaking through.\n\nA small gaggle of teenagers stood on the doorstep. They looked normal enough, wearing your standard teenage clothes. The youngest, maybe 12, wore a pink top with those sequins that made a different image depending if the sequins were pushed up and down. She was looking at it in awe and wonder as she cycled between the pony and castle. Then there was a maybe 14 year old who wore a tracksuit and joggers, looking like your typical chav. A 15 year old with a flowery dress and a jacket over the top and mismatched socks with her sandals and finally an 18 year old with smart trousers and a standard blue striped T-shirt with waistcoat stood at the front, smiling at me. Their clothes were a tad mismatched at times but they looked normal enough. I started to feel a little silly about bringing a knife before I noticed the tags and security tags still on their clothes. They were clearly thieves, so what were they doing here? My intrusive thoughts took over as I scanned for weapons, but found none as the 18 year old spoke.\n\n\u201cH-hello,\u201d he said nervously, \u201cthis is going to sound crazy, but in your son.\u201d\n\nI raised my eyebrow at him. \u201cNo you aren\u2019t. I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone except my wife. And I definitely haven\u2019t donated\u2026\u201d I froze, remembering when I donated my DNA. I looked at them closely and recognised a lot of my features in them, the blonde slightly curly hair, except for the 12 year old who\u2019s hair was blue and pink, the blue eyes and the oh so recognisable bump on the bridge of their nose that my mother had given me.\n\nThe 18 year old nodded. \u201cYes, we\u2019re your children.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get my ADHD?\u201d\n\nThe kid shook his head. \u201cNo, we got autism.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d I had needed to test them, in case they were lying, \u201ccome on in.\u201d I opened the door wider and beckoned them in.\n\n\n\n\\n\\nThey followed me to the kitchen where I kept microwaving my soup and collapsed into the chair, even the small exertion of standing in the doorway wiping me out with my illness.\n\n\u201cSo, why would the American government want to make children with my DNA?\u201d\n\nThe kids all moved awkwardly to take different spaces in the kitchen. The 14 year old hopped up on the worktop while the 15 year old started rooting through the cupboards.\n\n\u201cUh, not exactly.\u201d The 18 year old said. \u201cThey wanted to make soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoldiers?\u201d My blood ran cold at the thought. \u201cAnd why would I be the \u2018perfect candidate?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo physical conditions of any kind, you were a \u2018blank slate\u2019.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that, was it a compliment? But that wasn\u2019t important at the moment.\n\nI scowled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re their \u2018soldiers\u2019. Children.\u201d\n\nThe 18 year old nodded, holding out his hand a conjuring a small flame in it. I almost fell out of my chair in shock as the flame appeared. The 15 year old slapped the 18 year old, who looked sheepish.\n\n\u201cWay to ease him into it,\u201d she told him off.\n\nI pointed to the flame. \u201cHow the Heck did you do that?!\u201d\n\nThe flame vanished as the 18 year old held his hands up placatingly. \u201cThe government wanted more than soldier, they wanted super soldiers. So the experimented with your DNA. I was their first success. My body naturally produces several flammable substances, liquid and gas, and I can release and ignite them. My skin is also naturally more fireproof.\u201d\n\nI was still staring in shock at his hands where the flame had been. I nodded slowly. \u201cOk,\u201d is all I can manage.\n\nThe 18 year old points to the 15 year old. \u201cThis is Bonnie. Biologically augmented nano n___ intervention environment. Or Bonnie for short. A bunch of nanobots in her body can alter her body physically to overcome most challenges. Increased strength, intelligence, seeing in various spectrums, water breathing anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAugmented doesn\u2019t start with an O.\u201d\n\nBonnie gives a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that when I chose the name, I thought it did, due to the \u2018or\u2019 sound.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old steps forward. \u201cThe names Ex, my brain is quantumly linked with a quantum computer. If we were in a film, I\u2019d be the tech guy. Super smart, super fast thinking, can use the computer to hack any device.\u201d\n\nI nod. You\u2019d expect me to be even more surprised, but there\u2019s only so much surprise one man can have, and then it just reaches blind acceptance. \u201cAnd how\u2019d you get the name Ex?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientists always said that I was simply a part of the computer, an extension of it, so they,\u201d he pointed to the other kids, \u201cstarted calling me Ex.\u201d Finally I turn to the 12 year old girl. \u201cAnd you sweetie?\u201d\n\nShe looked to the other kids before standing straight and saying \u201cI\u2019m violet and I can change what I look like.\u201d Her hair then changed from pink and blue to bright red and then to blond, looking just like my own. She smiled at me with crooked teeth and I smiled back.\n\n\u201cOh that was wonderful. And how\u2019d you get your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favourite colour is violet.\u201d Her skin then changed to match that colour.\n\nTurning towards the 18 year old I asked, \u201cdidn\u2019t catch your name, what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlaze,\u201d he answered.\n\nI nodded, the reason seemed obvious.\n\nI made them a simple lunch, cooking up the rest of the soup before giving them juice and brownies for pudding.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running from the government, you can\u2019t stay here long.\u201d They nodded solemnly, except for violet who just looked disappointed. \u201cI can get you food, clothes that\u2019ll stick out less and transport. I can also give you some money to keep you going.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask you to do that, that would be so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got \u00a324 million from donating my DNA. Money that I planned to pass down to my kids and their kids. Far as I\u2019m concerned, that money\u2019s just as much yours as it is mine.\u201d\n\nAnd so, without giving them room to refuse, I bought a second hand car that someone was selling on the street, a couple months worth of imperishable food, new clothes and then gave them \u00a310,000 and the best tips and tricks to save money I know. And with that they hugged me goodbye and left.\n\nBarely two days later, two black trucks appeared outside my door and a team of troops emerged. The almost pounded my door down before I answered, as my wife kept our children back.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYour children, where are they?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want with my children? What\u2019ve they done? They\u2019re good kids! Go to school!-\u201c\n\n\u201cNot those kids!\u201d\n\nI furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know they visited you! Where did they go?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! I don\u2019t have any other kids! I haven\u2019t even had another partner!\u201d\n\nA woman in a black suit walked up to the door, commanding the soldiers to stand down. \u201cWe know you know, we tracked them here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kids are you talking about?\u201d I repeated, playing my best furiously confused civilian.\n\n\u201cAnswer our questions or we\u2019ll take these kids instead.\u201d\n\nI growled and glared at them with the fury I\u2019d never felt before. \u201cDo not touch my kids. Any of them. I don\u2019t know where they went, I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to ask. There\u2019s nothing I can tell you that can help.\u201d The woman held my gaze for a moment before nodding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd before you attempt to arrest me to lure those children you experimented on to turn into soldiers, this is being recorded and, if I don\u2019t stop it, it will automatically be uploaded to the internet.\u201d I warned. We held each others\u2019 gaze for half a minute at least before she backed down.\n\n\u201cMove out.

        "comment": "My face instantly becomes blank. I push away the hand of the paramedic who had been tending to the injury on my forehead before simply standing and walking away. I can\u2019t really describe what I\u2019m feeling.\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 apathy. I feel something. But it\u2019s not rage or grief either. I might just still be processing and the feelings will come later, but if I were to describe it, it would be the calm before the storm. It feels calm, but there\u2019s something else that means you can\u2019t quite relax. Something moving out of sight.\nMy home is on the other side of the city, my car was destroyed in the battle and public transport is down, but I don\u2019t care. I walk home, still not really feeling a whole lot. Nobody stops me, they can all tell now would be a bad time. They can all tell that interrupting my stupor could result in violent repercussions.\nWhen I arrive home I see that half of it is destroyed. I don\u2019t care. I step through the hole in the living room wall that my boyfriend had made and sit down on my couch. My phone buzzes, but I ignore it, gazing out the hole at the destroyed street. It buzzes gain and again. The recognisable ping of a message from Sally\u2019s, or I guess Lightning\u2019s, number.\nCalm as anything I pick up the phone and throw it against the wall as hard as I can, shattering it on the exposed bricks.\nThe landline rings. I sit back down. It keeps ringing. I pick up a piece of rubble. It goes to voicemail and my boyf- Sunbeam\u2019s voice comes through.\n\u201cCharlie! Are you ok? Don\u2019t turn on the news! I\u2019m com-\u201c the piece of rubble smashes into the phone, destroying it.\nI sit waiting for who knows how long. I am about to go make myself a cup of tea  when the super duo arrive. Sally hadn\u2019t even got out of costume, clearly driving so that Sam could get changed.\nI don\u2019t stand. I cross my arms and watch silently as he walks up to my destroyed house. As he steps through the hole in the wall he starts talking, a rush of words coming out.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what you saw! It was spur of the moment thing. It meant nothing. For the crowds. We were high on the victory and adrenaline. We weren\u2019t thinking. She\u2019s been my partner for so long. You get it, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Is all I say.\nHis face drops. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019re still the one I love.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d I say again.\nSally has now got changed and joined us in the house, spurting her own spiel of apologies.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. We\u2019ve been partners for so long. Our life in each other\u2019s hands. It\u2019s only natural we develop feelings. I didn\u2019t want to take him from you. I didn\u2019t mean it to go so far, but the crowds, and the victory. We got carried away.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d They look at me dismayed and confused.\n\u201cWhat do you mean no?\u201d Sally asks me.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I repeat, not looking either in the eyes.\n\u201cSay something other than no, please,\u201d Sam begs. \u201cI apologised, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s where you say something. Forgive me, get mad, something!\u201d\nIf I could get mad, I would. But no feeling a come, just a blank calm and acceptance. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? That I forgive you? That it\u2019s all ok. That it\u2019s ok you kept a secret life from me? That I don\u2019t mind you fell in love with my best friend? That I don\u2019t mind that I have seen you grow closer and exclude me more?\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Sam says. Sally looks down sadly at hearing that.\n\u201cYou know where your stuff is, if our room\u2019s still intact. I\u2019m sure you have a secret lair or something you can live in. Or maybe Sally will let you live with her.\u201d\nSam\u2019s face is one of shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nI don\u2019t answer, simply staring at him. He begrudgingly starts to trudge up the delicate stairs.\nSally\u2019s face has started to look furious as she marches after him, shouting about \u2018the past 6 months meant nothing?!\u2019 I don\u2019t waste time listening, walking to the kitchen and putting the kettle on. I take my tea next door and use my neighbours phone to call up damage control for resettlement. The blank feeling I have doesn\u2019t go as I walk back into my house to see Sam walking out with his stuff. By now people have found where he lives and are starting to arrive, taking pictures. The tabloids will have a field day, but I\u2019m not interested in that. I walk upstairs to my bedroom, picking up a ring he had gifted me. In hindsight, he\u2019d obviously taken it from a supervillain. The few times I\u2019d worn it, the ring had granted strange abilities, but the life had never enticed me so I\u2019d left it in my drawer, wearing it a couple of times to not seem rude to Sam. But now, I have a new reason to wear it. This city deserves a true hero. And for it to get that true hero, the old fakes must go.",

        "comment": "\u201cHave you ever heard of the Fermi Paradox?\u201d I ask my companion, Jesse, as we leave yet another desolate word. Yes, I have a companion. If I didn\u2019t I\u2019d lose myself if the infinite number of realities out there. Without something to connect me to my home I\u2019d be lost. They shake their head. \u201cIt\u2019s the question as to why humans haven\u2019t met aliens yet. One answer is the Great Filter, which posits that the reason we haven\u2019t met intelligent life yet is because there is some mass extinction event that befalls every single intelligent species.\u201d Jesse looks at me, confused. \u201cHow is this relevant?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t travel through time, only across dimensions. Which means what is happening to these Earths, whatever Great Filter this is, is happening in the present day. The same present day our Earth is in. Which means the Great Filter is now. Which means that\u2026\u201d \u201cThat what happened to these Earths could happen to ours,\u201d Jesse finishes. I nod to them. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find out what it is and stop it.\u201d I hold out my hand and they take it. Then the world around me stretches. It stretches more and more until it tears around me and I fall through the hole as it closes behind me. Well fall probably isn\u2019t the right word. Falling implies there\u2019s gravity, but there is no gravity in the void. There is no gravity, no time or space or air, light, sound or even consciousness. Whatever I experience in the void I never remember once out of it. For a few short seconds I see nothing, smell and hear nothing. I feel nothing except Jesse\u2019s hand in mine. The lack of oxygen might bother me if I needed to breath, but without time that isn\u2019t even necessary. I exist outside of time, in between two heart beats, between one breath and the next, in the middle of two ticks of a clock. After an infinite amount of time and no time at all I emerge into a bright light. I see and hear and feel again. I forget the experience in the void and all I feel is burning pain. Screams fill my ears and toxic gas invades my nostrils. I open my eyes to see a city harbour in flames. Right ahead of me, the Statue of Liberty melts into nothing. The sky is burning and the streets are a river of molten rock. Buildings around us crumble and people are screaming and panicking as the burn away. Some quickly, others slowly as the blacken and crumble to ash. We are only there for a few seconds before I drop us out of the universe, but the images I see are burned into my brain. We land face first into bright green grass. I gasp deeply, relishing the fresh air flushing the toxic air out of my lungs. My skin burns all over but it is already calming down as the air cools it. Next to me Jesse is coughing up sick, phlegm and blood as they gasp with me. \u201cWh\u2026 what\u2026 what was that?\u201d They choke. \u201cThe Filter,\u201d is I can say in answer. We breath deeply for a couple more minutes, during which I remember what I had seen. Not the people or the burning, but the shapes that moved. The shapes in the smoke and the gas. The movement of the flames, molten rock and the shadows. I speak again. \u201cWe need to go back.\u201d \u201cWhat?! We almost choked to death after being there for a couple of seconds! You saw what was happening there! We wouldn\u2019t survive!\u201d \u201cI can project a protective shield around us. But did you see the shapes there. It looked almost sentient. Almost alive and malevolent. If we want to protect Earth from this, we need to know what\u2019s going on, which means we need to go back and see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Jesse sighs and nods, taking my hand. \u201cOk.\u201d We dip back into the dark voice for a few seconds or years. I look around and see nothing. Just blank wasteland as far as the eye could see. Next thing I notice is the black sky. The sun shines as bright as day but the sky is dark. There is no atmosphere, the only thing keeping us alive is the small bubble of air I established around us before we left. Jesse looks around, confused. \u201cWhere are we? Did we end up in the wrong universe.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I answer, \u201cwe\u2019re in the same place we left. This is New York.\u201d \u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s nothing. We were only gone a couple minutes at most. Where\u2019s the buildings? And the sky? Where\u2019s the Atlantic gone?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d is all I can say. I bend down and feel the sand between my fingers. I see it start to twinkle in the sunlight. \u201cMetal.\u201d Jesse looks at me? Confused. \u201cThere\u2019s metal in the sand. From the disintegrated buildings.\u201d Looking up at the sky I keep talking \u201cwe need to go soon, without an atmosphere there\u2019s nothing to protect us from the sun\u2019s harmful radiation.\u201d Jesse nods and together we return to the world we just left.\n\n\n\n\\n\\nI open my eyes and find\u2026 nothing. The green rolling hills we\u2019d just left are replaced with deserted wasteland and black sky. Jesse looks around in horror. \u201cWe were just here! It was ok! What happened?!\u201d Again, all I can say is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d We slip back into darkness. But, this time it isn\u2019t dark. There is light. Light in the void. There is something in nothing. For the first time ever I feel and see. And I feel time moving. And I feel my need to breath. Desperately I do the single most stupidest thing I could have done. I change our direction mid travel and follow the light. I feel time passing. I\u2019ve never known how long it would actually take to travel dimensions if time actually existed in the void. Well now I am about to find out. And suffocate while I do. Hooray for me. Minutes pass. I start to pass out. I try to breath in but nothing happens. My vision becomes fuzzy and darkness creeps in. Then in one bright flash of light I can breath again. My lungs welcome the rushing fresh air and I collapse to the floor, gasping for air. I feel Jesse collapse next to me. I quickly look around to get my bearings and see a tall, metal tower. There is an arch towering above me. We are in Paris. I stand to see we\u2019ve attracted a small crowd. Travelling dimensions tends to do that. Quickly I give a small bow. \u201cThank you audience for watching the Great Reappearing Magician.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t disappear.\u201d \u201cNot yet,\u201d I answer with a wink before helping Jesse to their feet. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d I whisper. They nod, a panicked look on their face. \u201cWhat was it? I though the void didn\u2019t have light.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but whatever it is, it\u2019s coming here.\u201d \u201cWe should get everyone out of here.\u201d \u201cHow? By yelling that an apocalypse is coming through the void. Besides, if this has anything to do with the Filter then there\u2019s nowhere for these people to run. Best to leave them in peace. A ridiculously short man with a fabulous moustache and enormous top hat walks up to us and speaks in a German accent. \u201cExcuse me Monsieur, what are you talking about?\u201d I look at him weirdly. \u201cYou speak French words in a German accent. Who are you?\u201d The man chuckles and fiddles with his moustache. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t who am I, it\u2019s how are you going to protect this world.\u201d I look at him with my mouth slightly open. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to save the world? Whatever this is has destroyed planets in minutes. I\u2019m just a guy who can travel dimensions.\u201d \u201cAnd can take people with you. Allow me to guide you and this apocalypse will not stand a chance in the universe we choose.\u201d I look at the strange man.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cNo time!\u201d He yells as a ball of light appears in the middle of the crowd of tourists. It starts to grow scarily quickly, engulfing the crowd. I try to ignore the screams coming from inside as I take the strange man\u2019s hand. \u201cWhatever you\u2019ve got planned, I hope it works.\u201d Jesse takes my other hand. \u201cNo!\u201d I yell, \u201cyou could die here. You don\u2019t need to risk your life for this. I\u2019ll come back for you!\u201d \u201cUnless you die in the process in which case I\u2019ll be stranded, having lost my best friend in the world. I\u2019m coming with you. Either we die together or not at all!\u201d I try to shake their hand off, but they refuse to let go. The growing ball of light gets closer and closer to us. I feel the heat emanating off it and smell the burning of unfortunate civilians. As soon as the ball touches me, my skin feels like it\u2019s on fire. But I concentrate and fall back into nothing. But it\u2019s not nothing this time as my skin burns and light fills the darkness. I see Jesse to my left and the strange man to my right and I feel the lack of air in my lungs. Time passes. You could convince me it was hours if it wasn\u2019t for me surviving the suffocation. The man\u2019s hand pulls me along and I relax into the journey. Then I feel something new, emotions. Feelings that aren\u2019t mine. It\u2019s like the ball is speaking to me. I feel pain and rage. I feel it\u2019s boiling frustration at humanity. I see the worst humankind has to offer flying through its mind: war, famine, violence and crime. I see selfishness, corruption and lies as well as foolishness and climate change and a billion other crimes across a billion other worlds. The extent of it all, the horror and the hatred is almost enough for me to turn against humanity and let the ball go. But then I feel Jesse\u2019s hand tighten in mine and I remember. I remember all the good they have done, how kind and helpful they\u2019ve been across dimensions. I remember seeing other people: seeing someone help another across the road, seeing people say hi to random people and rush to the aid of an injured stranger; I see the apocalypses and I see hundreds of people helping each other up as they ran, dying to help others. I project these thoughts into the deadly ball and a million more good things humans have done. The heat from the ball isn\u2019t so bad anymore and I feel time slow down, the suffocation isn\u2019t so bad. Finally we land in a strange word. There is no one in it, a pure grassland with one old hut. I look down at my feet and see a small orange ball glowing warmly. \u201cIs that?\u201d Jesse asks from the floor where they had collapsed. \u201cI think it is,\u201d I answer, crouching down to look at the ball. \u201cThis thing destroyed planets?\u201d \u201cThis thing destroyed universes, \u201cthe strange man responds and I whip around, having forgotten he is there. He lifts the ball. \u201cWell done, I knew I\u2019d picked the right people to ask for help.\u201d He throws the ball into the air and my eyes follow it upward. In the air I see billions of stars lighting the sky like it\u2019s day. Then I see them moving and realise that these are all balls like this one. Great Filters or apocalypses. I look at the man incredulously. \u201cWhat do you mean? The right people to ask for help.\u201d \u201cI mean someone with an unshakeable faith in humanity because they have someone to hold onto. Most travellers like us don\u2019t have someone with us. We always end up so lonely. Some get bitter, only seeing the worst of humans and not having anyone to point out the good. Some end up like those,\u201d he points to the sky, \u201cbitter and angry.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s more than just me? And we can become those?!\u201d I yell in surprise. Jesse pats my shoulder hard. \u201cLike I said, moral support. Everyone needs it.\u201d I smile it then and hit them back. \u201cHow many more are there?\u201d The strange man raises his eyebrow at me, \u201chow many Universe are there?\u201d\n\n",

        "comment": "\u201cWoah! Why me? I\u2019m\u2026 like\u2026 the worst person to choose.\u201d I knew why. There were only 5 of us left in the bunker and none of us were exactly the people you\u2019d choose to represent humanity. A convicted rapist, the leader of a major American business, a person who had been in a cult right up until the start of the apocalypse, a child and me. Until the apocalypse the most I had accomplished in life was almost die due to a drug overdose. I had been on the streets and had done nothing with my life. So we drew straws to decide who would approach the aliens. Obviously I had drawn the short straw.\n\u201cYou agreed to this now get out there,\u201d the capitalist, Fred, said to me before pushing me to the door. I sighed and pressed the button to open it before walking into the wasteland. The door slammed shut behind me, almost as loud as the beating heart in my ear.\nThe world was silent for a beat. For two beats. I started to wonder if this was some sick joke but the ships came into view. Hundreds of the bristling with\u2026 something. Probably guns, I thought. The lead one did a flyby so close I was knocked to the ground. My heart was in my mouth as two more ships flew by. Finally, an hour after \u2018first contact\u2019, a ship landed and I faced these\u2026 beings for the first time.the approaching creature was twice the size of me and looked more like a snake than anything. Except this snake and six arms and 8 beady eyes looking straight at me. Next to it was what looked like a robot which was identical in form to the alien, except it was my size.\nThe creature and the robot approached before the creature spoke in a low voice that rattled my eyes. I had no hope of understanding it, so I just stood there dumly as silence passed for a couple of seconds. Then the robot spoke in almost perfect English\n\u201cHello human of America. I am [untranslatable] of the [untranslatable] empire. This robot will translate for us. Do you represent your race.\u201d\nI shrugged at the giant creature. \u201cI mean, I guess. There\u2019s nobody else here.\u201d\nThe robot translated and the creature spoke again.\n\u201cIn that case we will discuss the terms of your surrender\u201d\nMy eyes went wide and I gasped.\n\u201cSurrender? What are you talking about? You just got here.\u201d\nThe alien looked confused.\n\u201cYou have no military force. Your population is scattered and on its knees. Why wouldn\u2019t you surrender?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our nature,\u201d I shrugged, \u201cWe\u2019re stubborn like that. Wait, why would you want Earth? The ground has been scorched by solar flares, a deadly virus controls half the planet and all its natural resources have been plundered or polluted by us. What could Earth possibly have to offer?\u201d\n\u201cSpace,\u201d the robot translated, \u201cour population continues to grow and we must spread across the stars. Your natural resources can be purified and recycled. And the virus is merely an inconvenience, a clean up effort. Now will you surrender and kneel before me or will you fight a war you cannot win?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cUs humans aren\u2019t really the kneeling type. But you\u2019ll lose any war you fight against us.\u201d\n\u201c[laughter]\u201d the robot translated. The alien\u2019s version of laughter was almost humorous, it\u2019s arms span round in rapid circles and it\u2019s eyes all blinked rhythmically. \u201cOur force outnumbered your military at its strongest, but now your entire population numbers less than a million. Our technology makes your most advanced weapons look like sharpened rocks. How could you win? Where is our disadvantage?\u201d\nI gave my own laugh in return at the absurdity of the question. \u201cWin?! I never said we\u2019d win. We could never win that\u2019s hopeless.\u201d\n\u201cThen how will we lose?\u201d\n\u201cWell you see,\u201d I explain, \u201chumans are incredibly vindictive and spiteful. We know this is the end. We knew the end was coming before you even showed your slimy scales in this solar system. But that makes us something very dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt makes us hopeless. And a hopeless person has nothing left to lose. Do you know what\u2019s buried across this planet in the thousands?\u201d\nThe alien gave a gesture that was translated and the equivalent shaking its head.\n\u201cNukes. Nuclear weapons. Thousands of them and thousands of spiteful, angry and trigger happy humans. You see we can\u2019t win this war, but we\u2019ll make dam well sure you won\u2019t either. How many forces will you lose? How many ships destroyed? And what will you have to gain? A radioactive rock.\u201d\nThis was the wrong thing to say as the alien raised a blaster at my face.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare destroy your own world.\u201d\n\u201cWe already did.\u201d\nI answered simply and the alien pulled the trigger, blowing my brains out.",

Humans stuck to their cities, dwarves to their caves, elves to the cloud forests and the beastkin for the wildlands between.\nHumanity had always been warring among themselves and the other races had ignored this. That had been their mistake. Their second mistake was assuming the end of hostilities meant the humans had risen to a higher level of sophistication. They had instead stopped because someone had finally won, the Nameless Emperor. The Nameless Emperor had conquered all of humanity in a matter of years, yet he wasn\u2019t satisfied. He started his war against the beastkin residing in the wildlands surrounding the human cities. Being only hunter-gatherers mostly, the beastkin were incapable of holding back the human advance so fell quickly. They were quickly followed by the elves, yet the dwarves held out a little longer in their stone fortresses, though with no other enemies, the humans could dedicate their entire forces to sieging the dwarves and under that pressure, even the strongest fortresses fell. And now a resistance movement is fighting against the empire, working to regain their freedom.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what they told me. I was always skeptical of stories that painted one side as entirely the good guys.\n\n\u201cSo the human empire conquered you guys. And you expect summoning a single hero can save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA true hero can change the world.\u201d I raised my eyebrows at that.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d have to be one hell of a hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe spell was supposed to summon a true hero, one with the power to change our world. That\u2019s what the resistance was expecting, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry to disappoint you,\u201d I muttered, looking around the cold grey room she had taken me to. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say we were in some underground cave. The damp stone walls showing scratches of being mined.\nI thought hard for a second. If these people were telling the truth, that would mean that they needed my help and I couldn\u2019t turn them away like that. And if there was something they were lying about, well there was only one way to find out. I take a dee breath and speak. \u201cSo what do you need me to do?\u201d\n\nShe looked at me, surprised. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you said it, you need help taking out a tyrannical leader. I hate tyrants, and I can\u2019t exactly say no when someone needs help. So what do I do?\u201d\n\n\n(This story is becoming bigger than I expected, gonna post a link to the rest of the story as I work on it)",

        "comment": "\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I told the man desperately. \u201cMy roommate is just a normal guy, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe me! Just tell me where he is!\u201d The strange man shouted, sending spit flying at my face as he did.\n\u201cFine. He\u2019s at work, the local Lidl,\u201d I answered, hoping he\u2019ll believe me.\n\u201cAre you stupid?! If I can track down his house I can track down his work. And he\u2019s not there!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where he said he\u2019d. If he\u2019s not there, then I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes at me before lowering his gun. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known I was coming, made a break for it.\u201d As he left, he put his finger to his ear and spoke into what I assumed was a radio. As soon as the door closed, I ran into my roommates bedroom to dig out he secret stash. I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone. I dialled my friend\u2019s number and waited. Once he answered I didn\u2019t give him time for his usual greetings.\n\n\u201cSome guy is looking for you. I don\u2019t know who, but I know it\u2019s something to do with your assassin days.\u201d I hear a curse and then he starts to talk to justify but I cut him off. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain yourself, I know who you are now, I don\u2019t care who you were. What do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat grab bag, take it to where I had my first birthday party.\u201d With that, he hung up. I furrowed my eyebrows. He\u2019d always told me he hadn\u2019t had a birthday party. So if it hadn\u2019t happened, it didn\u2019t happen anywhere, it happened nowhere. Ohhhh, I got it.\n\n30 minutes later, I found myself outside a pub a few miles outside of town. Normally you could get there in half the time, but I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t being followed. The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home.",

        "comment": "It was hard for both of us. She hated men and you hated seeing her unhappy. You also both hated the curse. That goddamned curse. Until she got a kiss from her true love her kingdom would not prosper. Now the kingdom wasn\u2019t failing by any means, but it was far from doing well. \u2018Just scraping by\u2019 as the advisors had put it. Unfortunately, \u2018just scraping by\u2019 was not enough to protect us from war. So the king and queen had called out for dam near every prince in the land to kiss her. They called for single kings and polyamorous ones. The summoned nobles from all over but still nothing. She must have been kissing a hundred men a day at one point. Her lips were chapped and her mood was lower than ever. And most of these men weren\u2019t even gracious enough to make the kiss small. A simple peck would do by the wording of the curse, but no. They had to make it a full make out session. They had to get handsy and they just had to go to far. Almost every time I would have to pull them off and send them running. The king and queen were getting so desperate they had started calling on the lower class. But I knew all this would be in vain, you see, she didn\u2019t like men. The princess was into women yet we all knew how that would end up. Enough princesses had been abandoned and rejected to tell us that revealing that secret would be a bad idea. But I couldn\u2019t watch my kingdom suffer in fear of the war to come. Other kingdoms were becoming emboldened and our allies were becoming distant. If we couldn\u2019t help them, why should they help us. It was only a matter of time, so I put out my own call. Albeit quieter than the other one. I put out a call to all the lost princesses. Together, the princess and I would sneak out of the castle every night to meet one of them. They would talk, get to know one another and if there was a spark, they would kiss. The curse had still not been lifted, but the princess\u2019 mood had already lifted. She had hope, we both did. And we were making life long friendships along the way. She was also very happy to be kissing a tonne of beautiful, respectful women instead of hideous men. But where the true love\u2019s kiss came from was a shock to us all.\nIt was another evening. We had ten more men from the army lined up to shoot their shot, but the princess was nowhere to be found. We all went searching together, looking in her room, in bathrooms and eventually in servants quarters. \nWhen we did find her, she was locked in a broom closet with a maid. The king opened the door and gasped in shock and horror. I saw the two of them Break from what had obviously been a very passionate kiss, gasping. But then, before anyone could say anything, a bright light bathed us all. The princess started floating and we all had to turn away. When the light died down we all turned back to the princess and the maid looking nervously at the king. He too a while to speak.\n\u201cThe words of a spell can never be false,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cif this is your true love then so be it.\u201d The relief that spread across our faces overpowered any horror the suitors showed. The king took the maids hands.\n\u201cYou have saved my kingdom from this dreaded curse. Please do us the honour of joining our family.\u201d\nThe maid gave a curtsy, \u201cI would be honoured my lord.\u201d\nThe princess took her hand and together they left the closet.\n(That finishing pun was a complete accident but is too perfect to change)",

        "comment": "I gave a long hard sigh as I stood above 6 lonely graves on the hill. Fools the lot of them. To think they could live forever. Sloth was the first to go. It was a revolution. The education and employment system reborn. The golden age they called it. No one was lazy because they could do whatever work they enjoyed the most. And they had the opportunity throughout and beyond education to try anything they wanted. No one was lazy because they enjoyed working and wanted to, so Sloth died in their bed, refusing to fight their fate. Might have actually been wise looking back on it. Everyone worked, everyone had a job and got enough money. Everyone had whatever they wished for so there was no reason for envy. You wanted what someone else had and you got it. So Envy passed on wishing for my fate. Any time people got greedy for more they learned that greed makes everything seem better than it is. So people stopped wanting and became satisfied. Two of the triplet died only a few short decades after sloth. Greed and Gluttony, so similar they became nigh inseparable. But that doomed them to die together. Or blessed, I\u2019m not really sure anymore. Greed passed in a lavish bed begging for just one more pillow. Gluttony choked to death, which would have been impossible had he still had power over people. Pride died with the last tyrant. His oppressed populace, taught in secret by other nations, rose up and ousted him from power, executing him where he stood. Pride died standing tall, refusing help from us or the Heavenly virtue of forgiveness and grace. Wrath died in the aftermath. No more tyrants or monster to fight, only other normal people. People felt no pride or arrogance over others. They no longer needed Wrath, they learned to forgive. Wrath died fighting. Not valiantly or with grace, but kicking and screaming as he attacked a random person to incur their wrath. To keep going. And that left only me, the most primal of all the sins. Animals evolved to mate, it\u2019s how nature created humans and it\u2019s how life kept going. How could life go on without Lust? And that\u2019s what I thought, stood on that graveyard hill. But I didn\u2019t realise then what I now know. The reason why I finish the triplet with Greed and Gluttony. Lust isn\u2019t just sexual desire, it\u2019s Greed for it. It\u2019s an arrogant desire for sex disregarding other people\u2019s needs and wants. And without Pride or Greed or even Envy, there was nothing stopping me from fading too. So here I stand, watching the last Lustfull person on Earth dying of an STI. Ironic really, killed by the one thing sustaining me, reckless Greedy Lust. I\u2019ll be joining my family soon. Wherever dead ideas go. You probably won\u2019t remember. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. You\u2019ll forget me, leave me in the past as one of your many mistakes. Just please, grant me this dying wish, live on. May humanity live on so we may one day have a chance to return. In the hopes that one day you may make a mistake and resurrect us.",

        "comment": "I was relatively new to the supervillain business, a villain with the power to control water called La Siene. Now don\u2019t go judging me, villainy pays well. Well it does as long as you aren\u2019t in Paris. The Hero Ghost has built a whole network of heroes and informants to protect Paris from the Legion. Even the birds fought for him. But it wasn\u2019t like Ghost was ruthless. He was famous for his care for those he defeated, many of the people on his team were villains that he\u2019d reformed. He even married one.\nLong story short, Ghost was famously kind and friendly, despite his serious demeanour, but he was also impossible to cross with that network of his.\nOne night the legion was having a social at a bar when the door was smashed open. Ghost stood there, furious. His entire body is concealed by his costume, yet the tenseness all over and the way he carried himself, nobody dared speak as he walked in.\n\u201cWho. Did. It.\u201d He demanded.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific,\u201d one of the more smug villains said as he recovered.\n\u201cThe orphanage. You\u2019ll tell me who did it,\u201d he pulled out his pistol, \u201cor I\u2019ll kill all of you to make sure they die.\u201d\n\u201cYou seriously think you can intimidate us like that? We know you. You don\u2019t-\u201c\nThe gunshot went off before I realised he\u2019d raised the gun. There was a hole in the man\u2019s head as a look of shock passed over his face and he crumpled to the floor. There was a deathly silence.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me have to ask a second time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think you can beat all of us.\u201d\nA loud thud rang out as Ghost dropped his backpack and brought out a power core. We all stared in shock. This core allowed him to channel a stars energy through him, but it also gave him severe cancer. He hasn\u2019t used it since he got married.\n\u201cMy family lived in that orphanage. It wasn\u2019t blood but who cares. I became a hero to protect my family and that\u2019s also why I stuck to my morals. Without them, what\u2019s the point in being heroic.\u201d He glared at every terrified face in the crowd.\nWe all looked at each other, waiting for the one responsible to step forward. No one did.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s partly my fault. I gave you too much space. Too much freedom. Not anymore.\u201d\nI was the only one to escape that bar alive. I had 3rd degree burns across my entire body, 4th degree on my hands (completely burnt down to the bone) I spent a month in a coma before waking up. When I did, I found out that not only was I convicted for all my crimes, but Ghost had taken down the entire legion, dismantling until it was a bunch of fractured pieces clinging onto life. Many villains went to jail, many more died.\nIf I could go back, I would. Not to the day Ghost entered the tavern to stop him, that would have been impossible, but to the day before, so I could stop myself from destroying that damned orphanage.",

I didn\u2019t ask to become this. But for the mageless (the minority non-magic people) I had become a folk hero, capable of slaying any wizard.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d I warned. The mage just snarled.\n\u201cNo one is a match for my magic. You\u2019ve been fighting gladiators and weak, pathetic Sorcerors looking for notoriety, you haven\u2019t yet met a true wizard like me!\u201d He declared arrogantly\nI sighed and got into my battle stance, waiting for his move. Times were hard for the mageless, being imprisoned was a common occurrence as we had no magic to escape with. I had been forced into this arena from a young age and made to fight, so my movements were familiar and practised.\nThe wizard prepared his first spell, aiming a finger towards me and shooting a beam of light. It hit my chest like the beam of light from a magnifying glass to light fires, except this time he didn\u2019t even get a spark.\nI walked forward slowly as his brow furrowed. I wasn\u2019t truly a mageless, as a toddler I\u2019d been blowing up my parents garden willy nilly, but then *he* arrived.\nThe wizard started charge a fireball, building it up above his head. Some people might assume I was playing with my food, drawing it out for the crowd or for entertainment. But the truth was, I had done this three other times today and hundreds of times in my life and I was just tired. Physically yes, but also I was just sick of killing people and in no rush to do it again.\nWhen I was just a toddler, playing in my back garden, a powerful True Mage (immortal magic users from whom all magic originated) came to our house. He said I was destined to slaughter hundreds of magic users and to prevent this he would take my magic. My parents begged and pleaded but to no avail, as he placed a curse upon me to nullify all magic around me. My life was downhill from there.\nThe wizard launched his fireball at my feet. I covered my face to protect it from the flying rocks, but walked out of the smoke unharmed, much to the wizards dismay. He scowled and started to try and and conjure some other attack, but he didn\u2019t get to as I drove my sword deep into his gut.\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d I told him, \u201cand I\u2019ll leave the sword in, you may have a chance to survive.\u201d\nThe sheer terror in his eyes answered my question before his nod.\nI gently lowered him down onto the ground and into his own pool of blood as his healers rushed onto the battleground.\nI trudged off to my quarters, picking a large rock out of my arm from the explosion and bandaging my arm",
