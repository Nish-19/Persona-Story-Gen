Well, it was peaceful, until some space pirates decided it was easy prey to plunder frequently. Last time they stole your garden robot, and you want it back.",
        "comment": "# The Great Garden Robot Rescue\n\nOld habits die hard, Dr. Marcus Chen thought as he sketched modification plans for a manure spreader on his kitchen table. He\u2019d sworn off weapons design years ago, but technically, this was just agricultural equipment with... personality.\n\n\u00abGrandpa, is this where we calculate the splatter radius?\u00bb His granddaughter Lucy peered over his shoulder, her braids dangling dangerously close to his coffee cup.\n\n\u00abTrajectory analysis, Schraubenzieher,\u00bb he corrected, using his pet name for her - little screwdriver. \u00abAnd yes, we need to account for wind resistance.\u00bb\n\nIt had been two weeks since the pirates had stolen HERB. Two weeks of Lucy missing her robot friend, and two weeks of increasingly amusing reports about a garden robot driving raiders crazy with soil pH lectures.\n\nThe doorbell rang - the rest of the Tinkerers\u2018 Club had arrived for their weekly \u201equilting circle\u201c (which had produced exactly zero quilts but numerous interesting defensive patents).\n\n\u00abRight,\u00bb Old Joe said, setting down his toolbox. \u00abMartha\u2019s got the mechanical bits sorted, Doc\u2019s brought his \u201especial\u201c mixtures, and young Billy\u2019s finished reprogramming the crop drones.\u00bb\n\nMartha \u201eThe Mechanic\u201c Wilson spread out her blueprints next to Marcus\u2019s sketches. \u00abI\u2019ve modified the irrigation system. Those pirates want to steal our crops? Let\u2019s give them a proper washing first.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAnd I\u2019ve got something special brewing,\u00bb Doc Thompson added with a worrying gleam in his eye. \u00abJust need to borrow some of Joe\u2019s prize-winning compost.\u00bb\n\nLucy bounced in her seat. \u00abCan I show them my idea? Please?\u00bb\n\nMarcus nodded. His granddaughter might be twelve, but she had inherited both his engineering mind and her grandmother\u2019s mischievous streak.\n\nLucy pulled out her tablet. \u00abSo, HERB has this special protocol - Educational Override Mode. I helped program it for my science fair. When activated, he just won\u2019t stop teaching. And I mean won\u2019t stop.\u00bb\n\nThe adults exchanged glances. They\u2019d all experienced HERB\u2019s enthusiasm for horticultural education.\n\n\u00abRemember when he spent three hours explaining proper mulching techniques to the mailman?\u00bb Old Joe chuckled.\n\n\u00abThe pirates don\u2019t know about Override Mode,\u00bb Lucy continued. \u00abOne specific phrase activates it: \u201aWhat\u2019s the optimal soil pH for growing space carrots?\u2018\u00bb\n\nMarcus felt a grin spreading across his face. A grin he hadn\u2019t worn since his weapons designing days. \u00abAnd you\u2019ve taught HERB about space carrots?\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh yes,\u00bb Lucy\u2019s smile was angelic. \u00abIn great detail.\u00bb\n\nThe plan came together over cookies (Martha\u2019s) and suspicious-smelling coffee (Doc\u2019s). Each member contributed their expertise:\n\nMartha modified the grain augers to create a network of surprise transportation tubes. \u00abLike a water slide, but with more screaming,\u00bb she explained.\n\nOld Joe reprogrammed the livestock fence to create interesting patterns of static electricity. \u00abNon-lethal,\u00bb he assured them. \u00abMostly just makes their hair stand funny.\u00bb\n\nDoc\u2019s contribution smelled terrible but promised to attract every insect within fifty miles. \u00abPlus glitter,\u00bb he added. \u00abFor festive effect.\u00bb\n\nYoung Billy had turned the crop monitoring drones into a synchronized swarm. \u00abThey play the Chicken Dance,\u00bb he said proudly. \u00abWhile dispensing liquid fertilizer.\u00bb\n\nAnd Lucy? Lucy had been recording new educational content for HERB. Hours of it. About space carrots.\n\nThe pirates returned three days later. Their sensors would have shown the same sleepy farming colony - right until they landed.\n\nThe first wave of raiders met Martha\u2019s modified irrigation system. The second triggered Old Joe\u2019s electric field. The third discovered why Doc was banned from the county fair\u2019s chemical competition.\n\nAnd through it all, from the pirates\u2018 own ship, came HERB\u2019s cheerful voice: \u00abDID YOU KNOW? Space carrots require a pH balance of 6.0 to 6.5 for optimal growth! Let\u2019s discuss soil composition for the next three hours...\u00bb\n\nThe pirates lasted twenty minutes.\n\nThey returned HERB personally, along with a signed agreement to never raid the colony again. Their captain twitched slightly when Lucy asked innocently about space carrots.\n\nHERB, covered in pirate glitter and trailing happy insects, immediately began reorganizing Marcus\u2019s garden by botanical family while singing about proper composting techniques.\n\nThe Tinkerers\u2018 Club celebrated with Doc\u2019s suspicious coffee and Martha\u2019s cookies. Young Billy was already modifying the drones for the colony\u2019s spring festival. Old Joe and Martha were sketching something that looked suspiciously like a combination dancefloor and defense grid.\n\n\u00abYou know,\u00bb Lucy said, helping HERB alphabetize the herb garden, \u00abwe could add a module about space tomatoes to your database.\u00bb\n\nMarcus quickly hid his proud smile behind his coffee cup. His granddaughter might not design super weapons, but she understood something he\u2019d learned too late: the best defense systems were the ones that brought people together - even if those people were planning elaborate agricultural revenge.\n\n\u00abHey Grandpa,\u00bb Lucy called out, \u00abcan we modify the hay baler next? I have some ideas...\u00bb\n\nHERB helpfully began listing seventeen different uses for modified hay bales, and Marcus realized that retirement had never been so interesting.\n\nThe pirates? They spread the word: stay away from that quiet farming colony. Not because of the defenses, though those were impressive. No, it was the robot. The one that wouldn\u2019t stop talking about space carrots.\n\nSome weapons, Marcus reflected, watching his granddaughter sketch plans with their recovered robot, were most effective when they came with love, laughter, and extremely detailed lectures about proper gardening techniques.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, a little bit of glitter.",

        "comment": "# Curtain Call for Dr. Dramatis\n\nDr. George Malicetti (formerly known as Dr. Dramatis, Terror of Theater District) was peacefully deadheading his roses when he got The Call.\n\n\u00abGrandpa?\u00bb Sophie\u2019s voice was small, even for a five-year-old. \u00abMs. Primsworth says I can\u2019t be a tree anymore. She says I have to do... backstage.\u00bb\n\nGeorge\u2019s secateurs crushed a perfectly innocent rose stem. In his former life, such an insult would have resulted in a dramatic thunderstorm over the offender\u2019s house for at least a week. But he was retired. Reformed. Respectable.\n\n\u00abTell me everything, mein Schatz,\u00bb he said, already mentally calculating how much of his old equipment was still functional.\n\nApparently, Ms. Primsworth had decided Sophie was \u00abtoo enthusiastic\u00bb about being a tree. \u00abDistracting,\u00bb she\u2019d said. \u00abTrees should be still.\u00bb\n\nGeorge looked at his garden\u2019s prize-winning roses, which definitely didn\u2019t dance in time to classical music when nobody was watching. Absolutely not.\n\n\u00abBackstage is very important,\u00bb he told Sophie, while his free hand typed out a message to his former minions (now running \u201eDramatic Solutions LLC - We Make Your Events Villainously Good\u201c). \u00abIn fact, it\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u00bb\n\n\u00abReally?\u00bb Sophie sniffled.\n\n\u00abOh yes. Now, does your Kindergarten have a loading dock?\u00bb\n\nThree days later, George arrived at Little Sprouts Kindergarten wearing his most normal-looking cardigan (which only had three hidden pockets) and carrying a toolbox that definitely didn\u2019t contain repurposed weather-control miniatures.\n\n\u00abMr. Malicetti!\u00bb Ms. Primsworth\u2019s smile was as plastic as his reformed citizen act. \u00abHow... involved of you to volunteer.\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh, I dabbled in theater back in the day,\u00bb he said, which wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Threatening to destroy the Metropolitan Opera unless they cast his preferred soprano had involved quite a bit of theater.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re very simple here,\u00bb she said firmly. \u00abJust some cardboard trees and-\u00bb\n\n\u00abBEHOLD!\u00bb George winced. Old habits. More calmly: \u00abI mean, let me show you some sketches.\u00bb\n\nHis old lair\u2019s drafting table had worked overtime. The designs were perfect: elaborate enough to be magical, simple enough to seem possible. Probably.\n\nOver the next week, George deployed every non-lethal trick in his former arsenal. The trees Sophie had wanted to play? They would dance, but only when the script called for it. The enchanted forest would have actual twinkling lights (powered by a scaled-down version of his old death ray, converted to run on AA batteries).\n\nHis old nemesis, Captain Spotlight, now retired and going by Jim from Accounting, spotted him rigging the lighting system.\n\n\u00abDramatis?\u00bb Jim squinted up at the ladder.\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s just George now,\u00bb George said, carefully not activating the trap door under Jim\u2019s feet. \u00abAnd it\u2019s all legitimate.\u00bb\n\nJim watched him install another perfectly-focused spotlight. \u00abYour granddaughter?\u00bb\n\n\u00abSophie. They wouldn\u2019t let her be a tree.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAh.\u00bb Jim nodded sagely. \u00abNeed help with the rigging?\u00bb\n\nTogether, they created effects that would have made Broadway jealous. Everything was technically within budget, if you didn\u2019t ask too many questions about where the \u00abdonated materials\u00bb came from.\n\nSophie thrived backstage. George taught her the basics of theatrical magic - the kind that didn\u2019t require actual weather manipulation. She learned to cue lights, manage scene changes, and coordinate the other children who\u2019d been \u00abrelegated\u00bb to backstage work.\n\nThe night of the show arrived. George sat in the back, officially manning the main controls, unofficially ready to deploy emergency glitter if needed. His daughter and son-in-law were in the audience, unaware that the theatrical genius they were about to witness had anything to do with the father they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years.\n\nThe show began. Trees danced (on cue). Snow fell (hypoallergenic). Fog rolled in (non-toxic). Scene changes happened like magic (literally, but nobody needed to know that).\n\nDuring intermission, he heard Ms. Primsworth telling another teacher, \u00abI had no idea we had such talented backstage children!\u00bb\n\nSophie found him at his control panel. \u00abGrandpa! Did you see? Did you see how everyone clapped when the forest grew?\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou did that perfectly, mein Schatz. Timing is everything in sh- theater.\u00bb\n\nAfter the show, amid the chaos of proud parents and sugar-rushed kindergarteners, George\u2019s daughter approached his control booth.\n\n\u00abDad?\u00bb She looked at the elaborate setup, then at Sophie proudly showing other kids how to work the fog machine. \u00abThis was you?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI just helped with technical things,\u00bb he said. \u00abSophie did all the hard work.\u00bb\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s very... dramatic.\u00bb\n\n\u00abTheater is meant to be dramatic.\u00bb He hesitated. \u00abThe birthday party invitations are still open, you know. For Sophie.\u00bb\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment. \u00abMaybe... maybe we could do coffee first?\u00bb\n\nGeorge smiled. No maniacal laughter, no thunder crashes. Just a grandfather who\u2019d learned that the best special effects were the ones that brought people together.\n\nThough he did treat himself to one tiny lightning flash on the drive home. For old times\u2018 sake.\n\nAt the next parent-teacher meeting, Ms. Primsworth announced that the spring show would be \u00absomething simpler.\u00bb But by then, the backstage crew had a waiting list.\n\nAnd if anyone noticed that the Little Sprouts Kindergarten had better theatrical effects than the Metropolitan Opera that season, well, that was probably just a coincidence.\n\nProbably.",

        "comment": "# The Brutal Truth About Brooms\n\n\u201eSweeping\u201c Steve McGinnis adjusted his lime green robes with their enchanted sequins (now spelling out \u201eHONESTLY Good Deals\u201c instead of his usual \u201eMAGICAL Deals\u201c) and prepared to face another day at McGinnis\u2019s Premium Pre-Owned Racing Brooms & Magical Transportation Solutions.\n\nThe curse was three days old now. Ever since that incident with Mundungus Fletcher and that questionable Firebolt (\u201eOnly slightly singed! Previous owner was just very enthusiastic about speed!\u201c), Steve had found himself physically incapable of anything but brutal honesty.\n\n\u00abWelcome to McGinnis\u2019s Premium- well, actually, rather mediocre Pre-Owned Racing Brooms,\u00bb he announced to his first customers of the day, a young couple in matching Wimbourne Wasps scarves. The words tumbled out before he could stop them. \u00abWhere our prices are as inflated as my sense of self-importance!\u00bb\n\nThe couple exchanged glances but didn\u2019t leave. Strange.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re looking for something reliable,\u00bb the witch said. \u00abFor commuting.\u00bb\n\nSteve felt the familiar sales patter rising up, but what came out was: \u00abWell, I wouldn\u2019t touch anything in the front row. Those Cleansweeps look shiny because I had my nephew polish them for five hours, but they pull left harder than a politician during election season.\u00bb\n\nTo his surprise, the witch looked interested. \u00abReally? What would you actually recommend?\u00bb\n\nSteve found himself walking them to the back of the lot, where the less flashy stock lived. \u00abThis Comet 260. It\u2019s about as exciting as a History of Magic lecture, but it\u2019ll get you to work for the next decade without trying to buck you off over the Thames. Previous owner was a librarian who only used it for grocery runs and named it \u201aDewey.\u2018\u00bb\n\nThe couple bought it. At full price.\n\nBy midday, Steve was having an existential crisis behind his enchanted desk (which, he had to admit to a customer, only hovered three inches off the ground because the legs were uneven).\n\n\u00abI don\u2019t understand,\u00bb he complained to his reflection in the Somewhat-Reliable Mirror (now truthfully labeled \u201aShows You How You Actually Look, Sorry\u2018). \u00abI\u2019ve told seventeen people their dream brooms were actually nightmares, explained to a professional Quidditch player that his trade-in was worth less than a chocolate frog card, and admitted that our warranty is basically just creative writing.\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou do look rather stressed, dear,\u00bb the mirror commented. \u00abAnd those robes aren\u2019t helping.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAnd yet,\u00bb Steve continued, ignoring the mirror\u2019s fashion critique, \u00abI\u2019ve sold more brooms today than all last week.\u00bb\n\nThat\u2019s when Discount Diggle from across the street stormed in, his discount robes billowing unfortunately.\n\n\u00abMcGinnis!\u00bb Diggle bellowed. \u00abWhat\u2019s this new sales technique? My customers are asking why I can\u2019t be \u201arefreshingly honest\u2018 like you!\u00bb\n\n\u00abDiggle, your business model relies on people not checking their brooms for curses before leaving the lot, and we both know it,\u00bb Steve said, then clapped his hands over his mouth in horror.\n\nDiggle turned an interesting shade of puce. \u00abThis is some kind of trick. You\u2019ve found a way to fake sincerity! Well, I\u2019ll figure it out!\u00bb\n\nAfter Diggle left, Steve had his biggest test yet. Minerva McGonagall herself stepped into his shop, looking for a reliable training broom for Hogwarts first-years.\n\nThe old Steve would have tried to offload those flashy but unstable Shooting Stars he\u2019d got cheap from that questionable dealer in Knockturn Alley. But now...\n\n\u00abProfessor, honestly? Your best bet is this batch of modified Cleansweep Sevens. They\u2019re about as exciting as a flobberworm farm, but they hover at a safe height, have built-in Cushioning Charms, and the worst that\u2019ll happen is some mild sideways drift when they\u2019re low on magic. I\u2019ve got fifteen of them, and I\u2019ll cut the price if you take the lot because teaching kids to fly actually matters more than my profit margin.\u00bb He wheezed slightly, still not used to so much truth at once.\n\nMcGonagall\u2019s eyes twinkled in a way that reminded him uncomfortably of Dumbledore. \u00abHow refreshing, Mr. McGinnis. We\u2019ll take them all.\u00bb\n\nBy closing time, Steve had sold more brooms than in any previous week, received three offers to expand his business, and had been featured in the evening edition of the Daily Prophet as \u201eThe Honest Broom Dealer: A New Era in Magical Sales?\u201c\n\nAs he was closing up, Mundungus Fletcher slunk back into the shop.\n\n\u00abCome to lift the curse?\u00bb Steve asked hopefully.\n\n\u00abActually,\u00bb Mundungus shuffled his feet, looking embarrassed, \u00abcame to apologize. And maybe see about that Comet you said would be perfect for \u201asomeone who needs quick getaways but isn\u2019t too proud to prioritize reliability over speed.\u2018\u00bb\n\nSteve sighed and reached for his sales ledger. \u00abThird row, blue handle. It\u2019s got a loose twig in the tail that makes a whistling sound above fifty miles per hour, but the Invisibility Booster works perfectly and it can carry two people in a pinch. Not that I\u2019m encouraging any suspicious activity, which I have to mention because of the curse.\u00bb\n\nAs he wrote up the sale, Steve realized something. The curse might just be the best thing that had ever happened to his business. Though he\u2019d never admit that to Mundungus.\n\n\u00abYour robes are still horrible, by the way,\u00bb he added, because apparently, he still hadn\u2019t learned when to stop.",

Earth\u2019s Supreme Leader, who humans worship through the ritual of \u201esharing\u201c and \u201eretweeting,\u201c continues to display unprecedented wisdom by refusing to acknowledge our existence.\n\n\u00abTheir mastery of irony transcends our understanding,\u00bb noted Chief Science Officer Blorp. \u00abThey have achieved what our civilization only dreams of: the ability to make others laugh by stating things that are completely untrue, yet somehow more accurate than truth itself.\u00bb\n\n## The New York Times\n**Mass Hallucination or Elaborate Hoax? Media Experts Weigh In**\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Following weeks of increasingly bizarre reports from Chicago, media analysts suggest the ongoing \u201ealien visitation\u201c story is likely a sophisticated commentary on the state of modern journalism.\n\n\u00abThe beauty of it is how it builds,\u00bb noted Dr. Eleanor Martinez of Columbia School of Journalism. \u00abFirst, they establish the aliens\u2018 inability to understand satire, then reveal that their completely earnest attempts to document Earth are indistinguishable from The Onion\u2019s content.

More unexpected.\u00bb\n\n## Internal Memo: The Onion Editorial Staff\nRE: Alien Coverage Guidelines\n\nTeam,\n\nPlease note that all future stories about our recent visitors should include at least one absurd element to maintain plausibility.

        "comment": "# Syntax Error: Unexpected Power\n\nCaptain Strongarm, defender of Metro City and seven-time winner of \u201eMost Cars Thrown At Villains\u201c award, had never felt so powerless. The hospital machines around his thirteen-year-old son Tommy were having seizures - screens flickering, numbers scrambling, error messages cascading.\n\n\u201eIt\u2019s terminal,\u201c Dr. Roberts said, looking at a screen that was now displaying what appeared to be the entire script of \u201aThe Matrix\u2018 in real-time.\n\nSarah, his wife (superhero name: The Nullifier), grabbed his hand hard enough to crack concrete. \u201eNo,\u201c she whispered. \u201eWe\u2019ve fought everything from alien invasions to that giant sentient potato last summer. We can fight this.\u201c\n\nTommy, looking remarkably calm for someone supposedly dying, raised his hand. \u201eUm, quick question: when you say \u201aterminal\u2018, do you mean like... bash?\u201c\n\nThe doctor blinked. \u201eWhat?\u201c\n\n\u201eBecause I\u2019m feeling fine, just kind of... different? Like, I can see the hospital\u2019s network architecture in my head. Also, sorry about the MRI machine playing Doom, that was an accident.\u201c\n\nThe machines around them began displaying `Hello World` in various fonts.\n\nDr. Roberts consulted his tablet, which was now showing a blue screen of death with a suspiciously happy face emoji. \u201eThe readings are unlike anything I\u2019ve seen. When the super genes mix, sometimes the outcome isn\u2019t as expected. This appears to be...\u201c\n\n\u201eFatal?\u201c Captain Strongarm squeezed his wife\u2019s hand back, creating a small shockwave.\n\n\u201e...a Unix system,\u201c Tommy finished. \u201eI know this! Dad, I\u2019m not dying, I\u2019m just... compiling?\u201c\n\nA younger doctor in the back of the room looked up from her phone, where she\u2019d been frantically googling. \u201eOh! Oh my god, we totally misread this. He\u2019s not terminal-ill, he\u2019s getting terminal-access. It\u2019s a documented power manifestation from 2018 - the Chen-Nguyen paper on Digital Enhancement Through Genetic Expression.\u201c\n\n\u201eIn English, doctor,\u201c Sarah demanded.\n\n\u201eHe\u2019s becoming a human command line interface. It\u2019s like... having admin access to reality.\u201c\n\nTommy grinned and raised his hand. His fingers moved like he was typing on invisible keys, and suddenly everyone in the room was floating six inches off the ground.\n\n\u201eThomas Jonathan Strongarm!\u201c his mother scolded, \u201ePut us down this instant!\u201c\n\n\u201eSorry! Still working on syntax. Um... `gravity \u2014restore \u2014room 507 \u2014exclude self`\u201c\n\nEveryone dropped. Except Tommy, who remained hovering cross-legged above his bed, surrounded by glowing lines of code.\n\nCaptain Strongarm sat heavily in a chair that creaked ominously under his super-strength. \u201eBut... but we had plans. Hero Academy. Learning to throw buildings. Following in the family business.\u201c\n\n\u201eDad, this IS heroic! Look!\u201c Tommy gestured excitedly, causing the lights to flicker in time with his words. \u201eI can access any system, solve problems without punching them, and... oh cool, I just downloaded kung fu!\u201c\n\n\u201eYou what?\u201c\n\n\u201eMatrix reference, dad. We really need to update your pop culture database. Oh wait, I can probably do that now!\u201c\n\nDr. Roberts cleared his throat. \u201eI believe we may need to adjust our initial diagnosis. Your son isn\u2019t dying. He\u2019s just... upgrading.\u201c\n\nThe next few weeks were an adjustment. Captain Strongarm had to accept that his son\u2019s idea of training was different from the traditional \u201elift progressively larger vehicles\u201c approach. Sarah found herself learning basic coding just to communicate with her son during his more technical moments.\n\nThey had some interesting family discussions:\n\u201eNo, you cannot hack your sister\u2019s brain to make her share the bathroom.\u201c\n\u201ePlease stop optimizing the refrigerator - it\u2019s now refusing to open unless we provide a valid SSH key.\u201c\n\u201eWho taught the toaster to sing show tunes?\u201c\n\u201eYour grandmother\u2019s computer keeps calling her \u201aSupreme Commander\u2018. Change it back.\u201c\n\nThe Hero Academy had to create a whole new curriculum. Tommy wasn\u2019t the only one manifesting digital powers, but he was the first to accidentally turn the cafeteria into a Minecraft server.\n\nSix months later, Captain Strongarm watched his son coordinate a citywide emergency response through pure command line interface, rerouting traffic, controlling traffic lights, and organizing emergency services with a few lines of code.\n\n\u201eYou know,\u201c he said to his wife, \u201emaybe this isn\u2019t so bad. Different, but not bad.\u201c\n\n\u201eHe\u2019s still a hero,\u201c Sarah agreed. \u201eJust with better WiFi coverage.\u201c\n\nTommy floated by, surrounded by scrolling text. \u201eHey dad, want to learn Python? I promise it\u2019s not actual snakes this time!\u201c\n\nCaptain Strongarm smiled. His son wasn\u2019t following in his footsteps - he was coding his own path. And maybe that was even better.\n\n\u201eSure, son. Just... no more downloading martial arts directly into my brain. The kung fu gave me a migraine.\u201c\n\n\u201eDeal! Also, um, don\u2019t check your phone for a bit. I accidentally forked reality and now there are two sets of family photos from last Christmas.\u201c\n\nSarah sighed. \u201eI\u2019ll go get the backup drive.\u201c\n\nLife wasn\u2019t what they expected, but then again, the best source code usually comes with a few surprise features.\n\n`End_process story.exe`\n`Exit status: Happy`",

They\u2019re obsessive about documentation. \u00bbDocument everything,\u00ab Dr. Marcus said. \u00bbYour observations are crucial for understanding engagement patterns.\u00ab \n\nSure, but why do we need to learn about trauma response protocols? It\u2019s just marketing, right?\n\nTwenty of us selected. All teens. They say we\u2019re perfect for understanding the youth market. Can\u2019t shake the feeling there\u2019s more. The NDAs were intense - had to sign forms about whistleblower protections. For marketing?\n\nToday\u2019s lesson: \u00bbInfluence isn\u2019t about making people want things. It\u2019s about understanding why they want things.\u00ab \n\nHomework: Document our own purchasing decisions for a week. Include emotional states before and after. They\u2019re very specific about noting negative feelings.\n\n\u2014\n\n**Log Entry #17 - October 3, 2024**  \n*Advanced Persuasion Techniques*\n\nFinally getting access to real campaigns. They showed us the psychology behind the Sparkleverse Toys launch. It\u2019s... disturbing. The dopamine triggers are precise. Too precise.\n\n\u00bbNotice how the ad timing correlates with homework stress peaks?\u00ab our instructor said. \u00bbHow does that make you feel?\u00ab\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to be learning this to use it. Why do they keep asking how it makes us feel?\n\nMaya broke down crying during pattern recognition training. Dr. Marcus nodded like he expected it. \u00bbDocument your reaction,\u00ab he said. \u00bbInclude physiological responses.\u00ab\n\nStarting corporate rotation next week. They\u2019re very interested in our phones\u2018 storage capacity. \u00bbDocument everything.\u00ab\n\n\u2014\n\n**Log Entry #45 - November 12, 2024**  \n*Internal Corporate Placement - ToyJoy Inc.*\n\nSomething\u2019s odd in the archives. They placed me in documentation, supposedly to \u00bblearn corporate history.\u00ab But why am I cross-referencing internal memos with childhood anxiety statistics?\n\nMet other \u00bbbrand ambassadors\u00ab in different companies. We\u2019re all in positions with access to internal communications. All documenting. All gathering.\n\nToday\u2019s training: Digital evidence validation and secure data transmission. For marketing?\n\nThe fake social media accounts we\u2019re building... they feel like cover stories.\n\n\u2014\n\n**Log Entry #73 - December 24, 2024**  \n*Holiday Campaign Analysis*\n\nChristmas season. The manipulation is everywhere once you know the patterns. Sarah broke during the toy commercial analysis. \u00bbI can\u2019t stop seeing it,\u00ab she said. \u00bbThe way they\u2019re engineering need.\u00ab\n\nDr. Marcus showed us how to track dark patterns in apps marketed to kids. Called it \u00bbmarket research.\u00ab Felt more like building a case.\n\nNew training module: International data privacy laws. They say it\u2019s for global marketing. Why do we need to know about legal precedents in whistleblower cases?\n\n\u2014\n\n**Log Entry #102 - February 15, 2025**  \n*Project Integration Phase*\n\nIt clicked today. During the \u00bbviral marketing\u00ab workshop. We\u2019re not learning to create campaigns. We\u2019re documenting systematic exploitation.\n\nEvery skill they\u2019ve taught us has two edges:\n- Influence mechanics = manipulation evidence\n- Engagement metrics = harm documentation\n- Viral marketing = truth distribution\n- Corporate access = data gathering\n\nWe\u2019re not the next generation of marketers. We\u2019re something else entirely.\n\n\u2014\n\n**Log Entry #156 - April 30, 2025**  \n*Final Project Preparation*\n\nThe truth: The Brand Ambassador Program isn\u2019t creating marketers. It\u2019s training whistleblowers. Building a case. Teaching us their techniques so we can expose them.\n\nTomorrow, twenty of us release everything simultaneously:\n- Six months of internal documents\n- Psychological manipulation playbooks\n- Targeting algorithms for children\n- Executive communications about \u201eacceptable damage\u201c\n- Proof of intentional addiction engineering\n\nDr. Marcus finally said it: \u00bbYou needed to understand it completely to dismantle it effectively. Your youth isn\u2019t a weakness - it\u2019s your credibility. They targeted your generation. Now you\u2019ll show them why that was a mistake.\u00ab\n\n\u2014\n\n**Final Log - May 1, 2025**  \n*Project Implementation*\n\nRelease successful. #MarketingTruth trending globally. Every major outlet running our data. Stock prices plummeting for worst offenders.\n\nTurns out we\u2019re not the first class. There are hundreds of us now. In companies. Agencies. Platforms. All gathering. All preparing.\n\nThey tried to weaponize youth influence. Instead, they taught us how to break their system.\n\nDr. Marcus\u2019s last message: \u00bbThe best defense against manipulation is understanding it. You\u2019re not brand ambassadors - you\u2019re the antibodies. And you\u2019re just the beginning.\u00ab\n\n*[Log system shutting down. Project Influence declassification complete.

At least the faeries might make some use of her.\n\nLady Silvermist looked down at the baby girl, who was already reaching for her glowing wings. \u00abWell then, Margaret Rose, let\u2019s show your father what a proper education looks like.\u00bb\n\n\u2014\n\n**The Seelie Court, Time Indeterminate**\n\nMargaret\u2019s childhood lessons:\n- Monday: Quantum physics with the Dusk Sprites\n- Tuesday: Tactical warfare with retired Valkyries\n- Wednesday: Corporate takeover strategies with Brownies\n- Thursday: International law with Wandering Scholars\n- Friday: Advanced feminism with Queen Titania herself\n\n\u00abBut why can\u2019t girls be knights?\u00bb seven-year-old Margaret asked during teatime with Gloria Steinem\u2019s great-grandmother (who had gotten lost in the Faerie Realm in 1899 and stayed to start a suffragette movement among the pixies).\n\n\u00abExactly the right question, dear.\u00bb\n\n\u2014\n\n**Faerie, Various Moments**\n\nMargaret grew tall and strong, learning from beings who had never accepted human limitations:\n- Sword-fighting from warrior queens of forgotten kingdoms\n- Economics from dragons who hoarded knowledge instead of gold\n- Diplomacy from brownies who had negotiated peace between cats and mice\n- Technology from gnomes who had invented computers before IBM\n- Leadership from women who had changed worlds\n\nHer education was supplemented by carefully curated Earth media:\n- Star Trek (especially Captain Janeway)\n- Wonder Woman comics\n- I Love Lucy (for subversion techniques)\n- The first female astronaut training videos\n- Recordings of every suffragette speech ever given\n\n\u2014\n\n**The Human Realm, 1974**\n\nKing Richard IV sat on his throne, reading about the latest feminist protests with distaste. Twenty years of peace since getting rid of that troublesome girl child.

Behind her, an army of suits and briefcases\u2014human lawyers mixed with fairy barristers, corporate raiders alongside goblin gold-counters.\n\n\u00abHello, Father. I\u2019ve returned with a corporate takeover bid for the kingdom.\u00bb\n\nRichard blinked. \u00abWhat?\u00bb\n\nMargaret Rose smiled, sharp as elvish glass. \u00abWhile you were busy maintaining traditional values, I was learning about hostile acquisitions. Did you know the crown corporation\u2019s charter has several fascinating loopholes regarding succession?\u00bb\n\nShe gestured to her team. \u00abI\u2019ve brought the paperwork. And a few friends.\u00bb\n\nA fairy wearing horn-rimmed glasses floated forward with a stack of documents. \u00abYour Majesty might want to review Section 7, Paragraph 12 regarding gender-discriminatory practices in royal inheritance.\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou can\u2019t\u2014\u00bb Richard sputtered.\n\n\u00abOh, but I can. You see, while only twenty years passed here, I had rather longer in the Seelie Court. Time enough for several advanced degrees, an MBA from the Unseelie Business School, and a fascinating internship with a coven of corporate witch-lawyers.\u00bb\n\nShe placed a briefcase on the throne room floor. It opened to reveal sophisticated polling data, economic projections, and a complete modernization plan for the kingdom.\n\n\u00abThe board\u2014I mean, the nobles\u2014have already voted. Seems they\u2019re quite interested in my proposals for economic diversification beyond traditional feudal models. The unions love my worker protection plans. And the international community is very excited about having a progressive, female-led monarchy in the region.\u00bb\n\nRichard slumped in his throne. \u00abBut... tradition...\u00bb\n\n\u00abIs wonderful when it works, Father. But times change. Even in Fairy.\u00bb She turned to address the gathered court. \u00abNow, shall we discuss the transition plan?

And soap. It\u2019s complicated. Like legacy code.\u201c\n\nThe driver blinked.\n\n\u201eLook,\u201c Maria sighed, \u201eSOAP stands for Supporting Other Admin Professionals. We\u2019re a recovery center for burned-out IT workers. But we also provide actual soap because self-care is important, and somehow we ended up serving soup because everyone kept bringing ingredients and, well, error handling is important in any system.\u201c\n\nFive years ago, Maria had been a high-powered Systems Administrator for a Fortune 500 company. Then came The Incident. Nobody liked to talk about The Incident, but it involved three days without sleep, a server farm meltdown, and Maria trying to debug her own brain in the middle of a board meeting.\n\nNow she ran the SOAP Kitchen, operating out of a renovated warehouse with suspiciously good WiFi.\n\n\u201eWelcome to the SOAP Stack,\u201c read the sign over the door. \u201eWe handle all protocols - technical, physical, and chicken noodle.\u201c\n\nInside, the main room was divided into sections:\n- \u201eDebug Lounge\u201c (therapy area)\n- \u201eReset Station\u201c (showers and clean clothes)\n- \u201eRefresh Cache\u201c (kitchen)\n- \u201eSupport Forum\u201c (community space)\n\n\u201eMaria!\u201c called Jake from the Debug Lounge.

But I stopped before writing automation scripts!\u201c\n\n\u201eProgress not perfection, Chris. Progress not perfection.\u201c\n\nMaria watched her regulars file in. There was Sarah, who used to sleep under her desk at a major tech company, now teaching mindfulness through JavaScript metaphors. (\u201eYour thoughts are just notifications.

I heard you help people... reset?\u201c\n\nMaria recognized the symptoms: caffeine overdose, recursive anxiety loops, and a tendency to treat human interactions like troubleshooting sessions.\n\n\u201eWelcome to the SOAP Kitchen. First question: when was the last time you ran a self-care routine?\u201c\n\n\u201eI... can\u2019t remember. The logs are corrupted.\u201c\n\n\u201eOkay. Let\u2019s start with the basics.

Then we\u2019ll talk about implementing healthy boundaries without using actual firewalls.\u201c\n\nThe newcomer managed a weak smile.\n\nBy evening, the kitchen was full of its usual controlled chaos. In one corner, a meditation session (\u201esudo apt-get install inner-peace\u201c). In another, a group discussion about setting boundaries (\u201eNo, we can\u2019t actually block toxic people with htaccess\u201c).\n\nThe soup of the day was \u201eStack Overflow Stew.\u201c The soap of the day was lavender. The SOAP protocol lesson had been canceled because the instructor had actually taken a vacation - a success story.\n\nMaria watched her community of recovering tech workers share meals, stories, and terrible puns. Someone had written \u201egit commit -m \u201abetter life choices\u2018\u201c on the inspiration board.\n\nThe delivery driver returned, this time with actual soap supplies. \u201eI think I get it now,\u201c he said, looking around. \u201eIt\u2019s like... a full stack solution for human maintenance.\u201c\n\nMaria grinned. \u201eExactly! Though please don\u2019t say \u201afull stack\u2018 too loudly in here. It can be triggering.\u201c\n\nLater, locking up, Maria checked her old corporate email out of habit. Five years of unread messages. She smiled and marked them all as resolved.\n\nOn the wall, their mission statement glowed in soft LED:\n\n```\ntry {\n    provideSupportForAll();\n} catch (Burnout ex) {\n    extend(Compassion);\n    offer(Soup.or(Soap).or(SOAP));\n    return Hope;\n}\n```\n\n\u201eRuntime successful,\u201c she whispered, and went to make sure the coffee maker wasn\u2019t becoming sentient again.\n\nBecause sometimes, healing looks like SOAP in all its forms. And sometimes, the best error message is a warm bowl of soup and the reminder that you don\u2019t have to debug everything alone.\n\n`EOF // End of Feelings`",

I knew exactly who had bought that ambrosia salad. I\u2019d rung them up myself. The receipt was probably still in the system.

No pressure.\n\n\u00bbWhat if... what if we used this as a teaching moment? Create a new tradition? Maybe next year\u2019s potluck could be a fusion theme. Traditional recipes with modern twists? Everyone contributes their knowledge?\u00ab\n\nThere was a thoughtful silence.\n\n\u00bbI could teach a class on proper fermentation,\u00ab Thor offered.\n\n\u00bbWine-making workshops!\u00ab Dionysus perked up.\n\n\u00bbAngel food cake has gotten a bit basic,\u00ab Gabriel admitted.\n\n\u00bbAnd we do need to adapt to changing times,\u00ab God mused. \u00bbHave you seen what they\u2019re doing with air fryers?\u00ab\n\nZeus still looked grumpy but was running out of lightning. \u00bbFine. But NO MORE COOL WHIP.\u00ab\n\n\u00bbAgreed,\u00ab chorused everyone.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I ended up becoming the first mortal appointed to the Inter-Pantheon Culinary Education Committee. The pay isn\u2019t great, but the benefits are eternal. Plus, I got promoted to deli manager.\n\nThough I\u2019ll never tell anyone it was actually Jesus who bought the ambrosia salad. He was running late, the temple gift shop was closed, and honestly, He\u2019s had worse last suppers.\n\n*[Addendum: The following year\u2019s \u201eDivine Fusion\u201c potluck was a huge success, though we did have a minor incident with Thor\u2019s Instant-Pot mead.

The holoprojection showed a Bohemian farmer emptying his chamber pot into a midden heap. \u201eExplain \u201aoh dear.\u2018\u201c\n\n\u201eTheir gut flora is... primitive. Chaotic. Unstructured.\u201c The system\u2019s lights pulsed in distress. \u201eThey haven\u2019t even begun basic bacterial consciousness cultivation. The microbiomes show no signs of organized neural networks!\u201c\n\nThrough the cloaked ship\u2019s observation port, Zyx-427 watched as more humans emerged from their wooden dwellings into the crisp morning air. A woman in a long dress was feeding chickens. A priest was trudging through the mud toward a modest church, his black robes hitched up to his ankles.\n\n\u201eImpossible,\u201c Zyx-427 muttered. \u201eThe calculations were perfect.

Very, very early signs.\u201c\n\n\u201eHow early?\u201c Zyx-427 demanded.\n\n\u201eWell... imagine trying to establish diplomatic relations with pond scum.\u201c\n\nA small crowd had gathered near the village well, pointing at the morning sky where the ship\u2019s cloaking field was causing a slight prismatic distortion. A child shouted something about angels.\n\n\u201eSir,\u201c Yqp-891 ventured, \u201eperhaps we could... speed things along? A little genetic manipulation, some targeted bacterial seeding\u2014\u201e\n\n\u201eAbsolutely not!\u201c Zyx-427\u2019s secondary tentacles writhed in horror. \u201eThe Intergalactic Federation\u2019s First Contact Protocols are very clear.

The local humans are ingesting something they call \u201abeer.\u2018 The bacterial potential is... not insignificant.\u201c\n\nBelow, the village tavern was opening for the day. The owner was rolling out barrels of his latest brew, proud of his secret family recipe passed down through generations.

In cosmic terms, five hundred years is nothing.\u201c\n\nZyx-427 watched as the priest blessed the tavern\u2019s new barrels, making the sign of the cross.

Current bacterial development focused on fermented food and beverage applications. Primitive religious practices may indicate subconscious awareness of bacterial consciousness.

A dig that had taken six months of careful planning, forged credentials, and one very understanding Irish priest who\u2019d agreed to help after hearing Jesus\u2019s full story during confession.\n\nIn the back of the van, Maria clutched her worn backpack, her thirteen-year-old frame swaying with each bump.

Six months of her brother working as a translator for the church\u2019s \u201ehistorical preservation project,\u201c building trust, learning patrol schedules, and waiting for the right moment.\n\n\u201e\u00a1M\u00e1s r\u00e1pido!\u201c Maria urged, looking back through the rear windows at the approaching headlights.\n\n\u201eI translate old church documents for a living!\u201c Jesus shouted, wrestling with the steering wheel. \u201eThe most exciting thing I do is argue about comma placement in 16th-century manuscripts!\u201c The van fishtailed as he swerved around a boulder, his shoes struggling to find the right pedals in the dark.\n\nA bullet pinged off the side mirror.\n\n\u201eSanta Mar\u00eda, madre de Dios...\u201c Jesus muttered, then couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the irony as he caught his sister\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror. She was trying not to smile despite their situation.\n\n\u201eThe church will protect you both,\u201c Father McKenzie had promised before implementing his part of the plan. He\u2019d waited until the patrol change, started the van, and created enough confusion to let Jesus get Maria out. The priest\u2019s diving roll out of the vehicle hadn\u2019t been part of the plan, but then again, neither was the gunfire.\n\nJesus had spent months pretending to translate documents about ancient religious artifacts supposedly buried in cartel territory. In reality, he\u2019d been memorizing guard rotations, mapping escape routes, and noting which guards got high on their own supply. All while dressed in pressed khakis and a button-down shirt, looking every bit the underpaid academic he actually was.\n\nAnother shot cracked through the night. Maria ducked lower.\n\n\u201eHey,\u201c Jesus called back to her, trying to keep his voice steady as he took another turn far too fast. \u201eRemember what Mom used to say about my driving?\u201c\n\n\u201eThat you drive like an angel?\u201c Maria replied, her voice shaky but playing along.\n\n\u201eNo, that I drive like I\u2019m trying to meet Jesus early!\u201c He caught her eye in the mirror again, and this time they both laughed, the sound tinged with hysteria and hope.\n\nThe pursuing vehicles\u2018 headlights began to fade as Jesus navigated the maze-like paths he\u2019d spent months studying on satellite maps. Just a few more kilometers to the safe house where Father McKenzie\u2019s contacts would be waiting. Just a few more minutes until his sister would be free.\n\nAs the sun began to rise over the desert, painting the sky in colors that reminded Jesus of the illuminated manuscripts he normally spent his days studying, Maria finally fell asleep in the back seat. He adjusted the rearview mirror to check on her, remembering how their mother had always said he\u2019d been born to translate\u2014to help people understand each other.\n\nShe just hadn\u2019t specified that sometimes understanding meant knowing exactly when the night guards changed shifts, how to hot-wire a van, and why an Irish priest would risk his life based on a confession alone.\n\nJesus smiled tiredly. Maybe he\u2019d finally get that driver\u2019s license after all this was over. Though he had a feeling his next job translation wouldn\u2019t be quite as exciting\u2014and that was perfectly fine with him.",

I\u2019d never been this far from my cage alone.\n\nThe kitchen floor stretched before me like an endless desert. No cover. No protection. Just me and the terrifying open space. I could hear the Rumbling Beast (dishwasher) in the distance, and the Cave of Moving Waters (sink) was dripping its ominous melody.\n\n\u00abYou can do this, Pip. For Bella!\u00bb\n\nI made a dash across the floor, diving behind the Water Bowl of the Orange Menace. Chester, from his perch, slow-blinked at me.\n\n\u00abShe\u2019ll be back in an hour, you know.\u00bb\n\n\u00abThat\u2019s what they want you to think!\u00bb I declared, army-crawling behind the food bowl. \u00abThis is clearly a situation requiring heroic intervention!\u00bb\n\nI had almost reached the Sacred Gateway (cat flap) when disaster struck. The Roaring Demon (vacuum cleaner) sprang to life in the next room. I froze, every fiber of my being screaming to retreat to the Gilded Palace.\n\nBut then I remembered Bella. Sweet Bella, who always saved me the best sunflower seeds. Who never laughed at my fear of the Wooden Thunder (humans walking). Who taught me how to properly groom my whiskers for maximum dramatization.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I pressed on. The outside world beckoned through the Sacred Gateway - a world I\u2019d only glimpsed through windows. A world full of dangers, adventures, and possibly angry pigeons (Bella had warned me about pigeons).\n\nJust as I was about to make my brave leap through the Gateway, the front door opened. The Small Human entered, carrying a familiar white box.\n\n\u00abLook who\u2019s back from getting her vaccines!\u00bb the Small Human announced.\n\nThe box opened, and there was Bella, looking slightly annoyed but otherwise perfectly fine.\n\n\u00abPip!\u00bb she squeaked, seeing me frozen mid-heroic pose by the cat flap. \u00abWhat are you doing down there?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI... uh... dropped a sunflower seed?\u00bb\n\nLater, safely back in our cage, Bella explained about vaccines and veterinarians while I pretended I hadn\u2019t been planning a dramatic rescue mission involving three paperclips, a rubber band, and a very reluctant alliance with the Orange Menace.\n\n\u00abYou were really going to brave the outside for me?\u00bb she asked, touched.\n\n\u00abOf course not,\u00bb I lied, hiding my hastily scribbled rescue plans under the bedding. \u00abI am a sophisticated apartment rat. We don\u2019t do adventures.\u00bb\n\nBut we both knew the truth. I, Pip the Brave, had almost ventured into the great unknown. Almost. And somehow, that felt like victory enough.\n\nChester watched us from his cushion throne, a knowing smirk on his face. But I noticed he\u2019d left some of his kibble by the water bowl - perfectly positioned for cover in future missions. Just in case.\n\nAfter all, you never know when you might need to save someone from the dreaded Vet again.",

        "comment": "## The Art of Being\n\nI never expected my Art Therapy degree would lead me here, but life has a way of painting outside the lines. My clinic, tucked between a 24-hour laundromat and a defunct video store in downtown Detroit, specializes in helping animated characters transition. The neon sign flickers \u00bbArt Therapy\u00ab in faded pink, while a subtle enchanted sigil in the window lets cartoon characters know they\u2019re safe here. Most folks assume it\u2019s all about the physical transformation, but really, it\u2019s about helping characters find their true colors.\n\nToday was special. Three separate appointments, all Gummi Bears, all scheduled back-to-back. None knew the others were coming.\n\nSunni arrived first, now preferring to go by Sunny. They slipped through the portal hidden in the alley\u2019s street art, checking twice to ensure no humans had spotted them. Always breaking traditions, they had traded their signature bow for a smart bowtie.\n\n\u00bbI\u2019ve been mixing the Gummiberry juice differently,\u00ab they confided. \u00bbAdding extra berries makes my voice deeper when I bounce.\u00ab\n\nWe worked through the session, discussing their dreams of being the kingdom\u2019s first gender-nonconforming knight. The magic flowed naturally as we reshaped their form to match their heart\u2019s vision, their yellow fur taking on a slightly more golden hue.\n\nBefore Sunny left, they paused. \u00bbSometimes I wonder if anyone else feels like me.\u00ab\n\nAn hour later, Cubbi walked in - or rather, Cubi, as they\u2019d written on their intake form. Their pink fur was tied back in a delicate braid, still damp from sneaking through the rain.\n\n\u00bbThe others see me as the baby, always trying to be a brave knight,\u00ab Cubi whispered. \u00bbBut I want to be both brave AND pretty. Is that allowed?\u00ab\n\nWe spent their session talking about gender expectations in medieval fantasy settings while the magic helped their form align with their truth. Their pink fur gained a pearlescent sheen that caught the light beautifully.\n\nJust as Cubi was leaving, they admitted, \u00bbI wish I knew if any other Gummis understood.\u00ab\n\nMy final appointment was with Grammi, who had been secretly testing new Gummiberry juice recipes that made their voice higher. They pulled their hood tighter as they hurried past the late-night convenience store windows. They confided that their gruff exterior had been a shield, protecting a gentler soul within.\n\n\u00bbI\u2019ve spent years nurturing others,\u00ab they said, adjusting their apron nervously. \u00bbMaybe it\u2019s time to nurture myself.\u00ab\n\nAs we worked through their transformation, their purple fur softened to a lovely lavender, and their features became more aligned with their true self.\n\nThe magic of coincidence struck when all three happened to leave at the same time. There was a moment of shocked silence in my waiting room, with its mismatched chairs and coffee-stained magazines, as they recognized each other - really saw each other - perhaps for the first time.\n\nSunny spoke first. \u00bbYou too?\u00ab\n\nCubi\u2019s eyes welled up with tears. \u00bbAll this time...\u00ab\n\nGrammi opened their arms, and the three joined in a tight hug, their different-hued fur blending into a beautiful rainbow against the backdrop of peeling wallpaper and flickering fluorescent lights.\n\n\u00bbWell,\u00ab Grammi said, wiping away tears, \u00bbI guess we\u2019ll need to create some new Gummiberry juice recipes together.\u00ab\n\nSunny beamed. \u00bbAnd I can teach you both the sword dance I\u2019ve been practicing!\u00ab\n\n\u00bbAnd I can show you how to braid your fur!\u00ab Cubi added excitedly.\n\nAs they left together through the portal disguised as a graffiti masterpiece, chattering about starting a support group for other Gummis, I smiled and added another stroke to my canvas. Sometimes the most beautiful art isn\u2019t what you create on the outside, but the spaces you create for others to be themselves.\n\nAnd somewhere in the Gummi Glen, three bears are bouncing higher than ever before, finally free to be exactly who they are.",
