We get it.  \nWe also are aware how atrocious slavery seems to your civilization, and how long, and hard you fought against it.\", another representative interjected.  \n\"As civilized people, as people who understand, clearly, considering this community exists, how important cooperation is...why?  \nWhy does slavery still exist?\", the Human representative asked.  \nThe senate was silent, but disdain was clear on many members' face, while the Twelve just shook their head.\n\n\n\n\"What about the mighty warriors of the Fretheldi Civilization?  \nWhere the victor gains absolute control over the loser? Should they just erase tens of thousands of traditions?\", one of the Twelve asked.  \n\"What about the trillions of people each mid-tier and higher ranked civilization has, whom willingly enter servitude, and become slaves in exchange of resources, or chances for their offspring to get a better future?  \nAre they to be...freed from what? Themselves?\", another representative asked.  \nThe Human representative sank into a deep silence.\n\n\n\n\"But as intelligent lifeforms...freedom is a paramount right.\", the Human representative said in the end.  \n\"You arrived onto the Galactic scene when the Community has already been ruling this galaxy for millennia...  \nYou haven't experienced being killed for biomass, being harvested for soul energy, being enslaved for mining, enslaved to be experimented upon, enslaved and conquered to be bred like mares for the insectoids, or other races that can't live a peaceful life.\", one of the Twelve said.  \n\"You think slavery is bad, but all slaves have to be fed properly, their health indexes have to be above average, their offspring are required to have formal education and a chance to another status.  \nThese are all regulated, and the slave trade is under careful investigation constantly.\", another of the Twelve chimed in.  \n\"We...we didn't know...\", he muttered.  \n\"Of course, and that's your saving grace.  \nYou shall reimburse the 9 civilizations that you have warred with, and you shall be in charge of the slave trade of your sector, let it be a lesson, and learn the reason why we have this system in place.\", the Twelve said.  \nThe trial was dismissed, and the punishment meted out.  \nHumanity's distaste for slavery was justifiable, but their slavery, and the slavery practiced on the galactic stage are two different things.  \nNow, humanity has to learn to see things from a myriad other perspectives, perspectives that they might not even be able to see, let alone understand...",

        "comment": "I was born into a family of explorers, and we were renowned to not shrinking back from anything.  \nWe explored deathly caves both underground, and underwater, we explored volcanoes, shaky mountains, ruins, deadly planets....everything.  \nWe were famous for this.  \nMy grandfather, one of the best used to have a saying: \"You shouldn't be afraid of small spaces. You should be afraid of big ones.  \nOnes too big for what they're meant to be used for, with nobody around, because it should make you wonder why it's empty.\".  \nI never understood what he meant...until today.\n\n  \nWe visited a new planet, exploring it for possible colonization, or at least to see whether we can find something useful or not.  \nIt was covered in a forest of such proportions, skyscrapers would look like huts near these trees.  \nEntering such a forest, we saw a lot of flora, and no...fauna for some reason, but we didn't dwell on the topic.  \nMushroom, herbs, flowers, fruits...we saw everything, and the preliminary analysis was showing good results for the usefulness of them.  \nThen...we found it.  \nA structure, like a temple or palace...it covered the entirety of the forest in front of us.\n\n  \n\"It's...it's easily the size of a metropolis...\", one of my team members said.  \n\"Readings show that it's...it's at least 500 kilometers in width, and no reading on the length...  \nIt's already above the paygrade of my sensors...\", another muttered.  \nI looked around, at the vines, and flowers growing everywhere, and at the dirt on the structure.  \n\"Clearly, nobody is around, and haven't been around for a long time...  \nLet's enter.\", I said, but despite sounding casual...I already took out my weapon, and so did everyone else.  \nWe entered the structure, and my grandfather's words started sounding loud and clear in my mind.\n\n  \nInside, the structure was even bigger, the pillars seemingly endlessly rising upwards, as if the roof we saw outside didn't exist.  \nThe engravings on the pillars indicated the existence of intelligent lifeforms, for they were complex and...familiar to what we used to have tens of thousands years ago, depicting gods, and rituals.  \nWe walked around the empty halls, and found statues, altars, furniture like objects...all humongous.  \nEverybody was uneasy.  \n\"This is worse than when we entered that Lava Ant nest...\", one teammate muttered.  \nThe mood was depressing, and it was getting worse, as after hours of exploring, we still haven't found evidence of life here.  \n\"It's goddamn obvious people lived here! Look at the pillars, at the furniture! Hell, we found knives and whatnots!  \nWhere are they?\", someone complained.  \nThe unsettling feeling was getting worse, while grandfather's words were like a mantra in my head, as I started to look more and more at the structure...when I realized it.  \n\"Let's leave...quickly, this place shall be a Dead Zone to the Human Empire!\", I said turning around, following the drones we left as markers.  \n\"Why boss? We could find real treasures here.\", someone asked.  \n\"This structure...was once a mountain.  \nIt was carved out in one-piece to look like this.\", I said, and they all fell quiet.  \nWe hurried along, because we didn't want to deal with whatever was going on here...  \nWith how good the structure looked, if we ignored the dirt, and flora...it shouldn't have been ancient, and yet...it was empty...  \nWhatever happened here was recent, and if it managed to erase a civilization capable of carving out an entire mountain to build a temple...  \nWe wanted none of it.",

Stopped drinking, and started training madly, right now...  \nThe Crown Prince is as strong as a regular general of our border army.\", I said.  \nAt this the Emperor smiled.\n\n\n\n\"As of now, I only heard good things.\", the Emperor said.  \n\"Yes, Your Majesty, but sadly for us...the returnees might be willing to take care of the Empire, but the new souls are surely with their own agenda.  \nAlthough everyone has their own agenda, we have to be really careful to not let gaps in our authority roles, lest the Empire falls into the hands of outsiders.\", I said.  \n\"You already have a plan. Speak.\", the Emperor said.  \n\"The Crown Prince position needs to be solidified, albeit his recent actions are already doing that.  \nThe 3rd Princess shall be the next in line as she's one who won't marry outsiders anyway, due to her strange deviation in bloodline.  \nThe Empire's vault needs to be opened, and tasks need to be given to everyone with plentiful rewards.\", I said.  \n\"The new arrivals like quests, as usually?\", the Emperor smirked.  \nI nodded.  \nAt this the Emperor tapped gently the throne's arms, but the sound echoed loudly like a towering bell, silencing everyone.  \nThe meeting has started, and the Emperor didn't waste time to implement what we have discussed.  \nSoon, all people who seemed as if completely different began cleaning out monsters, spies, cults, bandits, and underground operations all over the Empire, for the sake of reputation and monetary rewards...  \nWhile unsettling, and annoying how they acted as if we didn't know about them...  \nThese \"isekai'd\" individuals, as some call themselves...are useful to the Empire...for now.",

        "comment": "I walk up the mountain, with corpses of monsters littering the path behind me.  \n\"The goddamn oversized lizards has too many pawns.\", I mutter, as I cut down yet another wyvern.  \nI walk, step-by-step through the trees, the rocks towards the palace atop the mountain where it resides.  \nThe dragon who killed my family, ate my dog, and burned my entire village down.  \n\"I am here.\", I mutter, as I kick in the doors.  \nEntering the palace...all I see are mountains of treasures.\n\n  \n\"Damn greedy lizard.\", I curse, my sword readied, my magic armor charged up.  \nFor ten years, I roamed the world, training with the best of the best in swordsmanship, and magic.  \nI didn't care what, and how much I had to pay for it.  \nI sold my status, I sold my wealth, I sold myself....for the sake of one thing, and one thing only.  \nRevenge.  \nAs I walked in the humongous halls, I heard a loud thud.  \nIt was here.\n\n  \nTurning around, from one of the hallways came out a gargantuan figure.  \nIt was a dragon of golden scales, and horns adorning its head, turning into a crown.  \n\"Great, the lizard evolved into a Dragon King.\", I muttered.  \nIt looked down at me, a single scale of the dragon being dozens of times bigger than my entire body.  \n\"You are of the royal lineage of the Azure Kingdom...  \nI remember devouring every descendant of that bloodline, to further my own.  \nFate was kind to you, little human.\", it said.  \nHearing it talk like that, rage took over my, as I started attacking.\n\n  \nIt was a pointless struggle.  \nMy magic bounced off of its scales, and my sword barely scratched it.  \nIts evolution made it transcend the mortal realm...I...I wasn't strong enough.  \nBut I wasn't one to give up.  \n\"I will end your suffering, little one.\". it said, grabbing me.  \nI allowed it, and I watched as the dragon swallowed me.  \nActivating my magic armor, and all the defensive talismans on me, I survived the journey through its body, arriving in its stomach.  \nI could see the acid trying to melt down my defensive barriers, but they were still holding on.  \nI started raging inside its stomach, cutting, and tearing, and firing fireballs, and all sorts of spells at my surroundings.  \nI did for hours, days...chugging potions to keep up with the consumptions, as I reveled in the roars of pain, and as I tried not to be washed away by the waves of stomach acid, and other liquids.  \nI did so until I could no more, and I lost consciousness.  \nWhen I awoke...I was covered in intestines, blood, and scales, as I seemingly cut my way out of its stomach.  \nThe dragon was on its side...blood dried on its entire body...dead.  \nI was naked...the acid completely burning through my protective measures...yet now...I was healed, without a scar...not even the scars of old, gained through fights.  \nCuriously...I picked up a fragment of my broken sword, and tried to cut myself...it failed to leave a mark.  \nRemembering a legend, I smirked.  \n\"I did it. Mother, father, sisters, cousins...everyone... I did it.\", I broke down, crying, and once again, losing consciousness.  \nWhen I awoke, I tidied myself, found some human clothes in the palace, and started to sketch out my future plans.  \nI had debts to repay...and with all this treasure...I had a new kingdom to start...in...in their memory...",
