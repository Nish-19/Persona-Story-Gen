The story delves into the themes of desperation, survival, and the moral implications of using forbidden magic to defeat the enemy. The plot is structured around the initial invasion, the attempts at negotiation, the escalation of conflict, and the eventual use of the Thaumic Plague to defeat the Magorath.
