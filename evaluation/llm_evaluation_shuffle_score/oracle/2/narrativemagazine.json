Her thoughts, feelings, and motivations are expertly conveyed through her interactions with others and her internal monologues. The author's use of subtle details, such as Judith's fondness for Georgia's quirky nature and her own struggles with her son's marriage, adds depth and nuance to her character.\n\nThe supporting characters, including Georgia, Colt, and Vivian, are equally well-developed.

The author employs a rich, descriptive language, painting vivid images of the market, the journalist's house, and the protagonist's emotional landscape. The use of metaphors (\"the market is our stage\"), similes (\"her voice, honeyed with the promise of a good deal\"), and personification (\"the streets that once seemed narrow and confining now stretch wide with possibility\") adds depth and texture to the narrative.\n\nThe sentence structure is varied, with a mix of short, punchy sentences and longer, more lyrical ones, creating a sense of rhythm that propels the reader forward.
