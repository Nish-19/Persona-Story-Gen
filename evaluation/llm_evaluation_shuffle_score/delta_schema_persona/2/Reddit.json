However, the character development is somewhat one-dimensional, with Neri serving primarily as a source of information and wisdom.\n\nThe story's tone is more formal and educational, which suits the narrative's focus on conveying information about mermaids and sirens. The protagonist's character is not as well-developed, with their thoughts and feelings primarily serving to facilitate the conversation with Neri.\n\nThe setting is well-described, with a focus on creating a sense of wonder and awe.
