The conflict is internal, revolving around the younger man's anticipation and the older man's skepticism. The narrative engages with the prompt by creating a sense of mystery and tension around the phone call and the green light.

The language is rich and evocative, with a mix of long, flowing sentences and shorter, impactful ones. The use of rhetorical questions and repetition (\"That the end was coming and coming soon\") adds to the sense of inevitability and dread. Descriptive language paints a vivid picture of the desolate island and the horrors that have befallen it. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the reader to fully absorb the gravity of the situation.
