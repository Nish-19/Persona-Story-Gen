The plot of Response A mirrors the structure and elements of the Human-Written story. The writer, Julian, grapples with the task of creating a children\u2019s story with a happy ending. His mother, Margaret, provides critiques, pushing him towards a conclusion that satisfies her expectations. The story unfolds with themes of hope and family bonds, culminating in a satisfying resolution.\n\nIn contrast, Response B presents a story with a different approach to the given writing prompt. The plot focuses on the relationship between the writer and his mother, with the creation of the children\u2019s story interwoven throughout the narrative. The story evolves with marginal emphasis on the writing task itself, and the climax of the story revolves around the mother's emotional state rather than the resolution of the writing project.\n\nBoth responses showcase a creative approach to the task, but Response A aligns more closely with the Human-Written story in terms of plot structure and progression. The narrative of Response A demonstrates a coherent and detailed plot, with a clear beginning, conflict, and resolution, adhering to the expected storytelling format for the writing prompt.\n\nResponse B, while touching upon the key elements of the prompt, offers a more narrative-driven approach. The story lacks a traditional plot development, making it less aligned with the Human-Written story's focused narrative.\n\nIn summary, the score rubric emphasizes the similarity in style to the Human-Written story with respect to the story-writing aspect 'Plot'. Response A better captures the essence of the Human-Written story, maintaining a clear and focused plot structure, thereby meeting the criteria set forth in the score rubric. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

In Response A, the writer's struggle to fulfill his mother's request for a happy ending adds a layer of emotional depth to the story. The creative process is depicted as a battlefield, which aligns with the theme of conflict found in the original story. Additionally, the concept of a princess who becomes a skateboarder introduces an unconventional reinterpretation of the classic fairy tale.\n\nHowever, Response B demonstrates a higher degree of creativity in its portrayal of the protagonist\u2019s struggle. The visualization of the writer's cluttered room and the metaphor of a dragon planting trees offer a vivid and imaginative backdrop to the narrative. Furthermore, the story of a pirate rabbit, who discovers the treasure of mismatched socks, showcases an unconventional blend of genres that elevates the creativity of the story. The playful tone and the inclusion of whimsical elements, like the cat dancing on the moon, further contribute to the story's overall imaginative quality.\n\nMoreover, the incorporation of the mother's influence on the storyline, with her well-meaning suggestions, provides an interesting commentary on the creative process. This interaction underscores the mother's impact on her son's work, thereby aligning with the original story's emphasis on the relationship between the mother and her son's writing endeavors.\n\nIn conclusion, although both responses incorporate elements of creativity, Response B excels in its integration of unique and imaginative elements, as well as its unconventional reinterpretation of the original story. It provides a more engaging and entertaining narrative that captures the essence of creativity as portrayed in the Human-Written story.

Both responses explore the relationship between the writer and his mother, but Response B provides a richer character development, particularly in the portrayal of the writer, Julian. \n\nThe writer, in Response B, is depicted as a person struggling with self-doubt and the pressure of his mother's expectations. This character development is crucial as it gives depth to the story and resonates with readers on an emotional level. Additionally, Response B presents a more immersive setting, with the study serving as the backdrop for much of the narrative. This setting is integral to the story and serves to enhance the reader's experience. \n\nMoreover, the story in Response B unfolds with a more coherent narrative arc, leading to the creation of a story that successfully satisfies his mother's demand for a happy ending. The evolution of the protagonist's journey and the eventual resolution add layers to the plot, further enriching the narrative. \n\nTherefore, while both responses aim to address the instruction, Response B more effectively aligns with the specified aspects of the score rubric.

However, there are moments where the prose feels slightly more polished than the original Human-Written story. \n\nIn contrast, Response B adopts a more experimental language style, with narrative elements that are richer and more varied than those in Response A. The use of irony, especially in the comparison between the dragon and the environmental concerns, adds depth to the story. Moreover, the description of the battlefield of ideas gives a vivid image of the writer's emotional state. This choice of descriptive language helps to create a more immersive and engaging narrative. \n\nAdditionally, Response B utilizes a variety of rhetorical devices and figures of speech, which enhances the storytelling aspect and contributes to the overall tone and atmosphere of the story. The creative way in which the protagonist, the writer, addresses the challenges of crafting a children's story shows a greater level of engagement with the story's context and theme.\n\nWhile both responses incorporate aspects of storytelling, such as character development, setting, and dialogue, Response B is more successful in matching the style of the Human-Written story with respect to the story-writing aspect 'Language Use'.

However, there are significant differences in the storytelling approach that set them apart.\n\nResponse A offers a more focused narrative on the woman and the boy, creating an atmosphere of immediate urgency and introspection. The narrative unfolds quickly, with little distraction from the central conflict. The reader is brought close to the characters' inner thoughts and emotions, allowing for a deeper connection with the plot. This response provides a clear and direct narrative that captures the essence of the prompt without veering off-topic or losing sight of the primary conflict.\n\nResponse B, while also adhering to the plot, presents a more complex and multifaceted narrative. It includes reflections on the woman's past decisions and the abstract concept of happiness, which adds depth and complexity to the story. The inclusion of these elements, however, results in a somewhat fragmented narrative that occasionally loses focus on the immediate threat posed by the falling plane. While the additional narrative details enrich the overall story, they do not align as closely with the immediate concern of the woman and the boy.\n\nTherefore, despite the effectiveness of both narratives in portraying the story's central conflict, Response A better captures the straightforward and urgent tone required by the plot.

The interactions between Olivia and James, although meaningful, are less dynamic and lack the emotional depth and tension that the Human-Written story encapsulates. Moreover, the description of the planes' movements and the surrounding scenery is not as vivid, leaving much to be desired in terms of immersion and engagement.\n\nResponse B, on the other hand, demonstrates a higher level of character and setting development. The protagonist's introspection and the description of the chaos surrounding the passengers add layers to the narrative. Furthermore, the character of James is well-developed, with his connection to the hat serving as a symbol of their bond and the absurdity of the situation. The setting is also well described, with the use of metaphorical language to evoke a sense of unease and impending danger.\n\nIt is important to note that while both responses attempt to depict a similar scenario, the depth and complexity of the characters and settings are key elements in determining the effectiveness of the story-writing aspect.

Although this method can be effective in conveying character dynamics and the significance of certain events, it lacks the depth of descriptive language found in Response A. The narrative style of Response B is straightforward, and while it does effectively communicate the essence of the characters' relationship and the emotional charge of their reunion, it does so in a manner that feels less nuanced than that of Response A.\n\nMoreover, Response B presents fewer imaginative elements, which limits its potential to creatively reinterpret the prompt.

It introduces the notion of the house having an unseen 'door' but does not delve into the fantastical implications of this element. While it does convey a sense of discontent and the psychological impact of living in such an environment, it falls short in providing a richer, more imaginative experience for the reader. \n\nThe comparison reveals that Response A exhibits a greater degree of creativity, including elements that move beyond the initial prompt into the realms of suspense and fantasy. Therefore, based on the specified criteria, Response A is deemed to be better than Response B due to its more profound exploration of creative storytelling elements. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

However, there are notable differences in the manner in which the development of characters and settings is achieved.\n\nResponse A demonstrates a stronger grasp of the narrative's tone and themes, consistently maintaining a sense of mystery and psychological depth throughout the story. It creates a vivid setting by describing the house and its surrounding environment in detail, setting the stage for the unfolding events. The characters are multidimensional, with internal conflicts and complex relationships that are explored through dialogue and descriptive narrative.\n\nMoreover, Response A adeptly interweaves the story's characters and their reactions to their environment, which adds depth to the narrative and provides the reader with a more immersive experience. This response also incorporates elements of suspense and the supernatural, creating a strong emotional arc that effectively engages the reader.\n\nIn contrast, Response B, while similar in its portrayal of the setting and its attempt to develop characters, falls short in certain areas. The emotional development of the characters is not as nuanced as in Response A, and the psychological aspects are less pronounced. The setting is described, but there is a lack of depth in the exploration of the house's peculiarities and the influence of the environment on the characters. The story also lacks the same level of suspense and mystery that is present in Response A.\n\nGiven these observations, Response A is the more effective narrative in capturing the story-writing aspect of 'Development (Character and Setting)', as it provides a more immersive and emotionally engaging experience for the reader. The attention to detail in both character and setting development, as well as the consistent narrative style, allows for a richer storytelling experience.\n\nSo, the overall judgment based on the given score rubric is that Response A outperforms Response B in terms of story-writing aspect 'Development (Character and Setting)'. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

Both responses have successfully captured the essence of the narrative and have followed the prompt in depicting the peculiarities of the Triangle Zone and the impact it has on the inhabitants.\n\nIn Response A, the use of language is characterized by vivid imagery and expressive emotions. The description of the house and its surroundings is detailed and creates a strong visual context for the reader. This is evident in phrases such as \"the house seemed to whisper promises of a fresh start,\" and \"the train roars past, its noise a distant hum, a reminder of the world we had left behind.\" Additionally, the narrative is structured with consistent pacing and strong dialogue that underscores the developing relationships and the emotional responses to the Triangle Zone.\n\nOn the other hand, Response B, while maintaining a consistent narrative, lacks the same level of detail and emotional depth found in Response A. The descriptions and the character's interactions are more subdued and less evocative. Phrases such as \"The house, with its odd shape and low cost, seemed to whisper promises of a fresh start\" and \"The trains continued their relentless passage\" are less elaborate and do not elicit the same strong imagery. Furthermore, the narrative in Response B does not flow as naturally and is less engaging in its depiction of the characters and their environment.\n\nThe main distinction lies in the choice of vocabulary and the construction of sentences, which affects the overall tone and engagement of the story. Response A effectively uses expressive language and complex sentence structures that engage the reader and create a compelling narrative. In contrast, Response B uses simpler language and less dynamic sentence constructions that result in a less immersive experience for the reader.\n\nConsidering the score rubric, which requires a focus on language use and penalizes divergence from the Human-Written story, it is clear that Response A is more closely aligned with the desired style of storytelling. It effectively employs diction, sentence structure, tone, rhetorical devices, figures of speech, narrative perspective, descriptive language, pacing, and dialogue to create an engaging and immersive narrative. Response B, although it captures the essence of the narrative, falls short in these aspects and does not consistently engage the reader in the same way as Response A. Therefore, it can be concluded that Response A is superior to Response B in terms of the language use aspect. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

There is a clear emphasis on the gradual transition from hope to acceptance, which parallels the shift from darkness to light within the narrative itself. This reflects a deep understanding of the plot elements required by the prompt.\n\nIn contrast, Response B approaches the topic with a more somber tone, delving into the heartache and sorrow experienced by the characters. It focuses heavily on the theme of loss and the emotional turmoil associated with the arrival of the hospice, thereby adhering to the prompt's requirement of exploring a space where hope seems to have vanished. However, the response slightly lacks in the portrayal of hope's re-emergence or any transformation towards a positive resolution, which is essential to fulfill the prompt.\n\nWhile both responses manage to introduce conflict, engage with the prompt, and attempt to resolve the narrative, Response A provides a more complete and satisfactory conclusion.

There is an attempt to portray the emotional journey of the characters, particularly Clara and her mother Marjorie, but the exploration of these emotions is somewhat superficial, lacking the depth and nuance found in the original story.\n\nIn contrast, Response B is much richer in its use of imagery and symbolism. The narrative seamlessly integrates these elements to reflect the characters' emotions and the overall atmosphere of the hospice. The descriptions of the settings and the patients' reactions to the word \"hospice\" contribute to a more immersive experience for the reader. Moreover, the narrative explores the characters' emotions with greater sensitivity and depth, allowing the reader to engage more deeply with the story.\n\nThe character development and the intricate way in which the story unfolds are more pronounced in Response B.

It carefully balances the dark reality of a hospice with elements of light and hope, as demonstrated in the transformation of the hospice from a place of despair to one of love and companionship. The development of characters and the creation of immersive settings contribute to a narrative that is both engaging and empathetic.\n\nResponse B, while maintaining the somber tone, tends to simplify the narrative, focusing more on the factual progression of events rather than on the emotional depth and complexity of the characters. While it does provide a glimpse into the characters' emotions, it lacks the intricate layering of the original story. The setting is also described in a more straightforward manner, with fewer metaphorical elements that could have added richness to the scene. Furthermore, the narrative doesn't explore as much character growth and emotional development, which were key elements in the original story.\n\nIn conclusion, both responses capture the essence of the task, which is to create a light in a space where hope seems to have vanished.

The character Maria is well-developed through her thoughts, feelings, and actions, while David acts as a foil to her emotions and beliefs. The setting, described as a dreamscape with a vivid sky, enhances the story's immersive quality. However, while the characters and setting are established, the progression of the narrative lacks the complexity and subtlety found in the Human-Written story. \n\nResponse B, on the other hand, achieves a similar level of character and setting development but with a richer and more nuanced portrayal. The characters Claire and David are well-rounded and their interactions reveal the underlying themes of the story. The setting is both surreal and grounded, with the inclusion of familiar and relatable elements that add depth to the narrative. The story\u2019s unfolding in a series of shifts also mirrors the layered complexity of the Human-Written story. \n\nThe use of dialogue and shared memories to develop the characters' personalities and relationships is effective in both responses. However, the characterization in Response B is more in-depth, delving deeper into the characters\u2019 motivations and emotional states. This results in a narrative that is not only similar in style to the Human-Written story but also enhances it with more complex character development. \n\nThe setting is also more thoroughly integrated into the story's themes and conflicts. The choice of words and phrases in Response B paints a vivid picture, further contributing to the narrative's immersive nature. \n\nOverall, while both responses do meet the requirements of the task, Response B outshines Response A by providing a more intricate portrayal of the characters and the setting, and by weaving these elements into a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking. The subtle nuances and the way the characters' development mirrors their evolution throughout the story is what gives Response B the edge.

The narrative focuses on George Floyd and the emotions and perspectives surrounding his death. It lacks a clear plot or linear narrative, instead choosing to express the theme through disjointed thoughts and recollections.\n\nIn contrast, Response A provides a coherent and structured plot. The story is centered on the protagonist, Sylvia, and her relationship with her deceased father. It uses the act of remembering as a means to explore the themes of grief, loss, and the importance of history and memory. The story progresses through a series of events that lead to a resolution, albeit an open-ended one, suggesting a form of closure through acceptance and remembrance.\n\nMoreover, Response A exhibits a stronger sense of conflict and character development. The protagonist's journey of discovery and acceptance is central to the narrative, as she confronts her past and reconciles her relationship with her father. This provides a clearer conflict and resolution, as compared to the Human-Written story.\n\nWhile both stories are thematically aligned with the prompt, Response A more effectively uses the story-writing aspect of 'Plot' to convey the themes of resistance and memory.

The integration of detailed imagery, varied sentence structure, and the exploration of themes like death, memory, and the human experience all contribute to the story's creative approach.\n\nIn contrast, Response B, while creative, leans towards a more conventional narrative style and less experimentation with form. The use of descriptive language is abundant, but it lacks the unique blend of perspectives and thematic resonance present in the Human-Written story. Moreover, Response B does not fully exploit the potential of genre-blending or unconventional storytelling techniques, which makes it fall short in comparison to the Human-Written story.\n\nTherefore, although both responses showcase creativity, Response A is superior in its approach to story-writing, particularly in its ability to interweave various stylistic elements and maintain a coherent and compelling narrative.

The pacing and progression of the story are not as engaging, which hinders the development of an immersive setting and well-rounded characters. The emotional undertones of the story are less pronounced, leading to a less impactful narrative.\n\nWhile Response B does address the basic plot of the original story, its execution falls short in comparison to Response A. It fails to fully capture the essence of the story, especially in the development of the characters and setting. This analysis highlights the strengths of Response A in comparison to Response B, particularly in their ability to capture and develop the elements of character and setting in line with the Human-Written story. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

            "1": "<evaluation>Analyzing the Human-Written story and the score rubric, it is clear that the 'Language Use' aspect was a significant part of the evaluation criteria. In both responses, there is an attempt to capture the same storyline and emotional resonance, however, the language and narrative structure vary in their execution.\n\nThe Human-Written story adopts a more direct and descriptive language style, using phrases such as \"Three days after they moved into their new apartment,\" and \"The woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window.\" These sentences provide a clear and vivid portrayal of the events. Additionally, the narrative is told from a more immersive perspective, allowing readers to experience the story as if they are present in the scene.\n\nIn contrast, the first response deviates significantly from the Human-Written story in its use of language. It utilizes a more abstract and reflective language style, seen in phrases like \"In this new chapter of my life, the ink is stained with questions and shadows.\" This choice of language makes the narrative less engaging and may detract from the story's immediacy. Moreover, the narrative perspective in the first response is more internal and introspective, which might hinder readers from fully connecting with the events being described.\n\nThe second response, while it maintains a similar plot and thematic elements, also uses a less direct language style and shifts to a more introspective narrative perspective. Phrases such as \"The woman from the building across the street, standing on her own balcony, staring directly at Romi\" and \"The shadows are still there, the whispers still haunt me\" are examples of the slightly more abstract language used in this response. This may affect the reader's ability to immerse themselves in the story and might limit their engagement with the narrative.\n\nIn summary, both responses diverge from the Human-Written story in their use of language, with the first response employing a more abstract and less direct language style and the second response utilizing a more introspective narrative perspective. These divergences hinder the reader's ability to engage with the story in the same manner as they might with the Human-Written story. Therefore, based on the evaluation criteria, the responses do not capture the same level of storytelling as the Human-Written story, specifically in terms of the 'Language Use' aspect. \n[RESULT] B</evaluation>\n<score>B</score>",

            "1": "<evaluation>Both responses illustrate a clear understanding of the prompt and present a plot that follows a coherent storyline involving an old woman's secret gray corner in a world where color is mandatory. However, there are several elements in which Response A outshines Response B, aligning it more closely with the desired story-writing style.\n\nThe first key element is the depth of detail and emotional resonance in Response A. This response takes readers on a journey of discovery and reflection, drawing on emotive language and vivid descriptions to create a sense of immersion. For instance, phrases such as \"a patch of faded walls and a floor that had long since forgotten the touch of paint\" and \"the alcove wrapping around them like a protective cocoon\" not only paint a picture for the reader but also evoke a sense of wonder and introspection. These elements are more effectively executed in Response A than in Response B, where the descriptions are less evocative and the emotional connection is less pronounced.\n\nAdditionally, the structure of the plot in Response A is more compelling. It skillfully intertwines the exploration of Mrs. Grayer's apartment with the narrator's reflections on the wider implications of a world where color is enforced. The narrative arc is smooth, with the revelation of the photograph and its significance serving as a powerful conclusion to the story. In contrast, the plot of Response B is less intricate and the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt, lacking the depth of character development and the broader societal implications that are present in Response A.\n\nFurthermore, the resolution of the narrative in Response A is more thought-provoking. It leaves the reader with a poignant realization of the value of subtlety and the importance of remembering the complexities of life. This resonates strongly with the prompt's focus on the meaning of a world that has forgotten the beauty of the in-between. On the other hand, the conclusion of Response B, while it conveys the message of defiance against the tyranny of color, lacks the same level of nuance and emotional impact.\n\nIn summary, Response A excels in its ability to craft a story that is not only coherent and well-structured but also rich in emotional depth and philosophical insight. It adheres closely to the human-written story's style in terms of plot, maintaining a clear narrative while incorporating the required elements of rebellion, the significance of the gray corner, and the larger implications for a color-driven society. Therefore, based on the criteria established by the score rubric, Response A is the superior response. \n[RESULT] A</evaluation>\n<score>A</score>",

            "1": "<evaluation>Both Response A and Response B attempt to address the concept of a world regulated by color and explore the theme of finding solace in the absence of color. However, the execution of these themes varies significantly between the two responses.\n\nResponse A presents a somewhat convoluted narrative, shifting between different voices and perspectives. While the response incorporates creative elements, such as the idea of a \"corner untouched by the chromatic decree,\" it lacks cohesion and seems to drift away from the central theme at times. Additionally, the response does not fully utilize the creative potential inherent in the story-writing aspect 'Creativity.' Instead, it reads more like a recounting of events than an exploration of a unique world.\n\nOn the other hand, Response B offers a more focused and streamlined narrative, maintaining a consistent voice throughout the story. It delves into the significance of the gray corner in a manner that is both creative and thought-provoking. By exploring the emotional implications of the character Eliza's decision to maintain a piece of the past, the response effectively captures the spirit of the story-writing aspect 'Creativity.' The inclusion of details such as the hues of the building's facade and the descriptions of the gray corner contribute to the vividness of the world being described. Furthermore, Response B introduces a network of individuals who share Eliza's perspective, offering a broader exploration of the themes presented.\n\nIn terms of creativity and the ability to express the core elements of the story, Response B demonstrates a more profound and coherent interpretation of the given prompt. It captures the essence of the world's colors, the rebellion against this color-regulated order, and the deeper meaning behind the gray corner in a more compelling and unique manner than Response A. Therefore, it can be concluded that Response B is superior in meeting the criteria for creativity as outlined in the score rubric. \n[RESULT] B</evaluation>\n<score>B</score>",

            "1": "<evaluation>Upon examining both responses, it is evident that Response B aligns more closely with the style of the Human-Written story in terms of character development and setting. Response B introduces a new character, Amelia, who is a volunteer with the Historical Aesthetics Society and who finds herself drawn into the story of Mrs. Grayer. Amelia's interactions with Mrs. Grayer provide a deeper exploration of her character, leading to personal growth and a sense of solidarity with those who have preserved the gray corners of the world.\n\nFurthermore, Response B presents a more vivid setting, giving the reader a clear picture of Mrs. Grayer's apartment and the stark contrast of the neighboring buildings. The description of the apartment serves as a backdrop for the unfolding narrative, illustrating the discrepancy between the world inside Mrs. Grayer's apartment and the bright, colorful world outside.\n\nAdditionally, Response B provides a more engaging emotional arc, as Amelia's curiosity about the past leads her to uncover the reasons behind the legislated coloring of the world. The narrative effectively uses the character's personal journey to encapsulate the broader theme of the story, namely the struggle to preserve the truth and authenticity of human experiences amidst an external imposition of vibrancy.\n\nFinally, Response B successfully delivers a narrative that resonates with the themes and elements present in the Human-Written story. By focusing on the key aspects of the story-writing aspect 'Development (Character and Setting)', Response B demonstrates a stronger adherence to the style of the original story. The careful crafting of character dynamics, the evocative portrayal of the setting, and the compelling narrative make Response B superior to Response A.\n\nSo the overall score is 8, as Response B excels in aligning with the style of the Human-Written story and providing a richer, more immersive narrative. \n[RESULT] B</evaluation>\n<score>B</score>",

Response A utilizes a narrative style that mirrors the Human-Written story's descriptive and introspective nature. The response effectively weaves in themes of memory, introspection, and the significance of the mundane within a world dominated by vibrant colors. Furthermore, the narrative voice remains consistent throughout, providing a sense of cohesiveness and depth to the storytelling.\n\nIn contrast, Response B takes on a more conversational tone.

The storytelling feels more straightforward and less layered, which deviates slightly from the Human-Written story's style.\n\nThe score rubric emphasizes the importance of the 'Language Use' aspect, and while both responses maintain a certain level of engagement, Response A better aligns with the original story's intricate language and richly described world.

Both stories introduce a character who must grapple with the consequences of a past action, thereby aligning with the story-writing aspect 'Plot' of the prompt.\n\nResponse A presents a nuanced portrayal of Paul, a character who is haunted by the weight of his past decisions. The narrative explores Paul's emotional turmoil and his struggle with the guilt he feels over his past actions. It successfully paints a vivid picture of the setting and the context in which the character operates. The story then navigates through Paul's internal conflict, which culminates in a resolution that shifts the protagonist's approach towards dealing with the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, Response B focuses more on the setting and the past actions of Paul, with a smaller emphasis on the conflict and the resolution. While the story introduces elements of struggle and change, the resolution does not delve deeply into how Paul deals with the consequences of his actions. The narrative lacks the complexity and depth that Response A offers in terms of character development and the exploration of the emotional aftermath of the protagonist's actions.\n\nIn terms of the plot structure, Response A does a better job of building tension, introducing conflict, and resolving the narrative with a clear sense of closure. This aligns more closely with the 'Plot' aspect of the prompt, as it effectively uses the story to engage with the prompt and showcase the protagonist's journey. Response B, while it contains elements of the narrative, does not convey these elements as effectively or as coherently.\n\nThe style of writing in Response A is also similar to that of the Human-Written story, utilizing descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive atmosphere.
