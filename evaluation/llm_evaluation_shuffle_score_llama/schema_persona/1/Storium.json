Each character is introduced with a unique background and setting that immediately establishes their individuality and the tone of their respective worlds. Meredith's silent warship, Hallam's burning aspen grove, Kyllian's darkened halls, Rosalita's stormy ride, Monika's warped audition room, McCoy's eerie cemetery, Romy's expanding bookstore, and Verne's transforming tunnel all contribute to a rich, varied tapestry. The emotional arcs are subtly woven into the narrative, with each character experiencing a moment of disorientation and realization that they are in an unfamiliar, shifting environment.

Dray is a thief trying to steal from Nakra's palace. Raine is a bounty hunter chasing a fugitive, and Keb-Keb is a Force-sensitive wanderer facing a group of thugs.
