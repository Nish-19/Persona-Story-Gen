The Human-Written Story has a natural and witty dialogue, with a clear sense of the characters' personalities and relationships. The Assistant stories have more stilted and formal dialogue, with less sense of the characters' personalities and relationships.\n\n</evaluation>\n\n<score>\nAssistant A: 3\nAssistant B: 2\n</score>",
