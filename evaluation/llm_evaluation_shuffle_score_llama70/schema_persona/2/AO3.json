However, Bilbo, who has experienced bullying himself, takes pity on the bird and decides to let her stay. As the story progresses, Trix grows into a striking and mischievous companion, and Bilbo realizes that she may be more than just a pet \u2013 she's family.\n\nThe story is structured around the developing relationship between Bilbo and Trix, with the conflict escalating as the court's disapproval grows.

The story also skillfully establishes the seaside setting, incorporating sensory details like the sound of the Tannoy and the feeling of the cold morning air.
