The moral dilemma is evident in Lyra and Bronn's decision to help the aliens rather than fight them, highlighting themes of empathy and coexistence.\n\n2. **Central Conflict and Climax**: The central conflict revolves around the arrival of the alien swarm and the potential threat they pose. The climax is reached when Lyra communicates with the aliens and understands their plight, leading to a resolution focused on cooperation.\n\n3. **Cyclical Plot Structure**: The story does not strongly exhibit a cyclical plot structure. It follows a linear progression from the aliens' arrival to the resolution of coexistence.\n\n4. **Twist or Revelation**: The revelation occurs when Lyra learns about the aliens' true intentions and their need for a new home, which shifts the story's direction from potential conflict to collaboration.\n\n5. **Reflective or Philosophical Tone**: The conclusion is reflective, emphasizing hope and the resilience of life, aligning with the author's preference for a philosophical tone.\n\n**Story B:**\n\n1. **Unintended Consequences and Moral Dilemmas**: Story B also addresses unintended consequences, as the alien swarm's arrival transforms the village and forest. The moral dilemma is present in the villagers' initial fear and the decision to seek peace and collaboration.\n\n2. **Central Conflict and Climax**: The central conflict is the villagers' fear of the aliens and the potential threat they pose. The climax occurs when Vyrnax and the alien leader propose an alliance, leading to a resolution of unity and transformation.\n\n3. **Cyclical Plot Structure**: Similar to Story A, Story B follows a linear progression without a clear cyclical structure.\n\n4. **Twist or Revelation**: The revelation is the aliens' peaceful intentions and the potential for mutual benefit, which shifts the narrative from fear to cooperation.\n\n5. **Reflective or Philosophical Tone**: The conclusion is reflective, focusing on the promise of a future where both worlds thrive together, aligning with the author's preference for a philosophical tone.\n\nBoth stories align well with the author's preferences, particularly in exploring moral dilemmas, providing a climactic resolution, and concluding with a reflective tone. However, neither story strongly exhibits a cyclical plot structure. Story A slightly edges out in terms of the depth of the moral dilemma and the emotional impact of the revelation.\n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 4  \nStory B: 4  \n</score>  ",

The key elements to consider are the blending of science fiction with philosophical themes, reinterpretation of traditional genre elements, introduction of imaginative technological concepts, exploration of human and societal evolution through speculative scenarios, and integration of cosmic horror and existential dread.\n\n**Story A:**\n1. **Blending Science Fiction with Philosophical Themes**: Story A introduces the philosophical theme of coexistence and understanding between different species. The alien swarm's arrival prompts a reflection on empathy and the necessity of finding common ground, which aligns well with the author's preference for philosophical themes.\n2. **Reinterpretation of Traditional Genre Elements**: The story reinterprets the traditional fantasy setting by introducing an alien species that interacts with familiar fantasy creatures like elves and dwarves. This is a creative twist on the genre.\n3. **Imaginative Technological Concepts**: While the story does not focus heavily on technology, it does mention the aliens sharing their knowledge and technology, which enriches the world of Elarith. However, the technological aspect is not deeply explored.\n4. **Exploration of Human and Societal Evolution**: The narrative explores societal evolution as the inhabitants of Elarith learn to coexist with the aliens, leading to mutual enrichment and understanding.\n5. **Cosmic Horror and Existential Dread**: The story touches on existential themes through the aliens' desperation and the initial fear of the unknown, but it does not delve deeply into cosmic horror.\n\n**Story B:**\n1. **Blending Science Fiction with Philosophical Themes**: Story B also explores philosophical themes, particularly the idea of sanctuary and the blending of different cultures and technologies. The narrative emphasizes cooperation and mutual benefit.\n2. **Reinterpretation of Traditional Genre Elements**: The story creatively combines fantasy elements, such as dragons and magic, with the alien swarm, offering a fresh take on the genre.\n3. **Imaginative Technological Concepts**: The story introduces the concept of blending alien technology with magic, creating a new form of power. This is a more explicit exploration of imaginative technology than in Story A.\n4. **Exploration of Human and Societal Evolution**: The narrative focuses on societal transformation as the village integrates alien technology, leading to a new societal structure and enhanced magical abilities.\n5. **Cosmic Horror and Existential Dread**: While the story hints at a greater threat from which the aliens are fleeing, it does not fully explore cosmic horror or existential dread.\n\nBoth stories creatively blend science fiction with fantasy and explore philosophical themes, but Story B provides a more explicit integration of imaginative technological concepts and societal evolution.

The weight of the mission and the urgency of finding other civilizations are clearly depicted, showing the protagonist's internal struggle and determination. The character's interactions with alien civilizations also highlight their role as an agent of change, bridging the gap between Earth and other worlds.\n\n2. **Setting**: The settings in Story A are richly detailed and integral to the plot. The barren planet and the bustling world are vividly described, with each setting reflecting the themes of decay (the desolate planet) and renewal (the vibrant city). The settings are not just backdrops but play a crucial role in the narrative, influencing the protagonist's journey and discoveries.\n\n3. **Societal Issues**: The story uses character interactions to reveal deeper societal issues, such as the need for unity and understanding across different civilizations.

However, the moral dilemma is not deeply explored.\n2. **Central Conflict and Climax**: The central conflict is the villain's attempt to drive the protagonist insane, which is resolved when the protagonist explains their mental resilience. The climax is subtle, occurring during the conversation rather than through action.\n3. **Cyclical Plot Structure**: The story does not exhibit a cyclical plot structure. It is linear, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n4. **Twist or Revelation**: The revelation is that the protagonist's mind is naturally chaotic, which is why the villain's whispers had no effect.

The moral dilemma is implicit in the protagonist's acceptance of chaos.\n2. **Central Conflict and Climax**: The central conflict is similar to Story A, but the climax is more pronounced as the protagonist gains clarity and turns the tables on the villain.\n3. **Cyclical Plot Structure**: The story hints at a cyclical structure through the protagonist's reflections on past experiences, suggesting a continuous journey of self-discovery.\n4. **Twist or Revelation**: The revelation is more impactful, as the protagonist realizes their resilience comes from embracing chaos, which shifts the power dynamic with the villain.\n5. **Reflective or Philosophical Tone**: The story concludes with a strong philosophical tone, emphasizing harmony and acceptance over resistance.\n\nOverall, Story B aligns more closely with the author's preferences for the \"Plot\" category, particularly in terms of thematic depth, the impact of the revelation, and the reflective tone.

The philosophical theme of understanding one's chaotic mind is present, but the lack of science fiction diminishes its alignment with the author's preference.\n2. **Reinterpreting Traditional Genre Elements**: The story uses the traditional villain-hero confrontation but does not significantly reinterpret these elements in an unconventional way.

The protagonist's chaotic mind and acceptance of their mental state are central to their character development. The dialogue with the villain reveals the protagonist's moral choice to accept their mind's chaos rather than be broken by it, aligning well with the author's preference.\n\n2. **Settings Reflecting Themes of Decay and Renewal**: The setting of the villain's lair is described as dark and gloomy, which aligns with the theme of decay. However, there is less emphasis on renewal within the setting itself, though the protagonist's realization of their mind's strength could be seen as a form of personal renewal.\n\n3. **Character Interactions Revealing Societal Issues**: The interaction between the protagonist and the villain touches on the theme of understanding one's mind, which could be extrapolated to societal issues of mental health and resilience. However, this is not deeply explored.\n\n4. **Characters as Agents of Change**: The protagonist is portrayed as an agent of change in their own life, as they come to terms with their mental state and use it as a strength. This aligns with the author's preference for characters who enact change.\n\n5. **Richly Detailed Settings Integral to the Plot**: The setting is described with some detail, but it primarily serves as a backdrop for the character interaction rather than being integral to the plot.\n\nOverall, Story A aligns well with the author's preferences, particularly in character development and the protagonist's role as an agent of change.\n\n**Story B:**\n\n1. **Character Development through Internal Conflicts and Moral Choices**: Story B also focuses on the protagonist's internal conflict and their acceptance of their chaotic mind. The protagonist's journey through their mental landscape is vividly described, highlighting their moral choice to embrace rather than resist the chaos.\n\n2. **Settings Reflecting Themes of Decay and Renewal**: The setting in Story B is more metaphorical, with the protagonist's mind described as a fortress and a labyrinth. This reflects both decay (the chaos within) and renewal (the protagonist's acceptance and understanding), aligning well with the author's thematic preferences.\n\n3. **Character Interactions Revealing Societal Issues**: The interaction with the villain is more introspective, focusing on the protagonist's internal journey.

However, it adds a layer of cultural respect and environmental awareness, which is a fresh take.\n3. **Incorporation of Humor**: Story B includes some humor, particularly in the initial interactions with the old woman, where the friends mockingly refer to her as a \"real-life witch.\" This adds a light-hearted touch before the seriousness of the curse sets in.\n4. **Imaginative Dialogue**: The dialogue in Story B is more imaginative, with the old woman's cryptic warnings and the friends' banter adding depth to the character dynamics.\n5. **Unexpected Elements**: Story B introduces unexpected elements by having the resolution involve acts of respect and environmental stewardship, which subverts the typical \"find the witch and apologize\" trope. This adds a layer of moral and thematic depth.\n\nOverall, Story B aligns more closely with the author's preferences for creativity, particularly in its use of humor, imaginative dialogue, and unexpected elements that subvert genre conventions.\n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 3  \nStory B: 5  \n</score>  ",

            "1": "<thinking>  \nIn evaluating both stories based on the \"Development (Character and Setting)\" category from the Author Writing Sheet, we need to consider several aspects: character development through interactions and dialogue, multidimensional characters with conflicting motivations, settings that enhance the narrative's tone, character transformations reflecting internal changes, and the contrast between mundane settings and extraordinary events.\n\n**Story A:**\n\n1. **Character Development through Interactions and Dialogue**: The story effectively uses dialogue to reveal character traits and dynamics. For example, Tom's dismissive attitude and Jake's arrogance are shown through their interactions with the old woman. Sarah's unease and eventual leadership in finding the solution also come through dialogue.\n\n2. **Multidimensional Characters with Conflicting Motivations**: The characters in Story A are somewhat multidimensional. Jake, Emily, Sarah, and Tom each have distinct personalities, but their motivations are not deeply explored beyond the immediate need to survive the curse. There is some conflict, such as Tom's skepticism versus Sarah's urgency, but it is not deeply developed.\n\n3. **Settings that Enhance the Narrative's Tone**: The setting of a Mediterranean town with its bustling market and the oppressive heat effectively enhances the narrative's tone. The setting is vividly described and contributes to the tension and urgency of the story.\n\n4. **Character Transformations Reflecting Internal Changes**: The characters undergo a transformation from arrogance to humility, particularly Jake and Tom, who initially dismiss the old woman. This change is reflected in their actions and dialogue by the end of the story.\n\n5. **Contrast Between Mundane Settings and Extraordinary Events**: The story contrasts the ordinary setting of a vacation in a foreign town with the extraordinary event of the curse. This contrast is well-executed, as the friends' holiday turns into a desperate quest for survival.\n\n**Story B:**\n\n1. **Character Development through Interactions and Dialogue**: Story B also uses dialogue effectively to develop characters. The friends' initial arrogance and mockery of the old woman are clear through their interactions. The dialogue captures their transformation as they realize the seriousness of their situation.\n\n2. **Multidimensional Characters with Conflicting Motivations**: The characters in Story B are slightly more developed in terms of conflicting motivations. Leo's skepticism and eventual panic add depth to his character. The group's dynamics shift as they face the curse, showing some internal conflict and growth.\n\n3. **Settings that Enhance the Narrative's Tone**: The setting of a small village with its sun-drenched streets and the oppressive heat is vividly described and enhances the story's tone. The setting plays a crucial role in the narrative, emphasizing the curse's impact.\n\n4. **Character Transformations Reflecting Internal Changes**: The characters in Story B undergo a clear transformation. Their journey from arrogance to understanding and respect is well depicted, particularly through their actions to lift the curse.\n\n5. **Contrast Between Mundane Settings and Extraordinary Events**: Story B effectively contrasts the mundane setting of a tourist visit with the extraordinary event of the curse. The transformation of the sun from a friendly presence to a deadly force is a strong element of this contrast.\n\nOverall, both stories align well with the author's preferences for character and setting development, but Story B slightly edges out Story A in terms of character depth and transformation.\n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 4  \nStory B: 5  \n</score>  ",

Jamie's sarcastic comment about the \"real-life witch\" and Max's dismissive \"Oh please, granny\" are examples of this. However, the humor is not particularly strong or witty, and it doesn't significantly enhance the character interactions.\n\n2. **Descriptive Language**: The story uses descriptive language effectively to create vivid imagery. Phrases like \"the laughter echoed down the sun-drenched street\" and \"the pavement shimmered like molten glass\" help paint a clear picture of the setting and the oppressive heat.\n\n3. **Conversational Tone**: The story maintains a conversational tone, especially in the dialogue between the friends.

The integration of fantasy elements, such as the interpretation of stars and celestial omens, is well-executed, providing a rich backdrop that feels both fantastical and grounded in a reality where such beliefs hold power.\n\n2. **Reinterpreting Supernatural Creatures**: While Story A does not explicitly reinterpret traditional supernatural creatures, it does use the concept of celestial signs in a way that feels fresh and integral to the plot. The stars themselves act as a supernatural force influencing the characters' actions and beliefs.\n\n3. **Humor to Subvert Genre Conventions**: The story maintains a serious tone throughout, focusing on the political intrigue and the protagonist's struggle against Alden. There is little to no use of humor to subvert genre conventions, which is a missed opportunity to align more closely with the author's preferences.\n\n4. **Modern Cultural References**: The story does not incorporate modern cultural references, instead opting for a more timeless, medieval fantasy setting. This choice limits the contemporary twist that the author prefers.\n\n5. **Theme of Identity and Transformation**: The story explores the theme of identity through Edrin's struggle to reveal Alden's true nature and protect his own legacy. However, the transformation aspect is less pronounced, as the focus remains on Edrin's steadfastness rather than a personal evolution.\n\nOverall, Story A aligns moderately with the author's preferences for creativity, particularly in its world-building and thematic exploration, but lacks in humor and modern cultural references.\n\n**Story B Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Blending Fantasy and Reality**: Story B also creates a world where celestial signs influence leadership, similar to Story A. The setting is less detailed, but the concept of the stars guiding destinies is effectively woven into the narrative, maintaining a balance between fantasy and reality.\n\n2. **Reinterpreting Supernatural Creatures**: Like Story A, Story B does not feature traditional supernatural creatures. The stars serve as the supernatural element, but there is no unconventional reinterpretation of creatures.\n\n3. **Humor to Subvert Genre Conventions**: Story B maintains a serious tone, focusing on the protagonist's confrontation with Darius. There is no evident use of humor to subvert genre conventions, which does not align with the author's preference for creative storytelling.\n\n4. **Modern Cultural References**: The story lacks modern cultural references, opting for a more traditional setting. This choice does not provide the contemporary twist that the author favors.\n\n5. **Theme of Identity and Transformation**: Story B explores identity through Aria's challenge to Darius's leadership and the villagers' realization of the truth. However, like Story A, the transformation aspect is not deeply explored, focusing more on the collective awakening rather than individual change.\n\nStory B aligns moderately with the author's preferences for creativity, particularly in its thematic exploration, but similarly lacks in humor and modern cultural references.\n\nBoth stories demonstrate creativity in their world-building and thematic elements but fall short in humor and modern cultural references, which are key aspects of the author's preferences.

This juxtaposition of grand fantasy elements with a simple, relatable human desire effectively blends the two realms.\n\n2. **Reinterpreting Supernatural Creatures**: The story reinterprets the Dragon King in an unconventional way, portraying him as a tea-loving creature with allergies rather than a fearsome tyrant. This humorous twist subverts the typical dragon trope, aligning well with the author's preference for reinterpreting supernatural creatures.\n\n3. **Use of Humor**: Humor is a central element in Story A, as seen in the absurdity of Thad's adventures and the reactions of the guild members.

This adds depth and humor, aligning well with the author's preferences.\n\n5. **Varied Sentence Structures**: The story employs varied sentence structures effectively, maintaining a lively and engaging narrative pace. The mix of dialogue and narrative keeps the reader's interest throughout.\n\nOverall, Story B aligns more closely with the author's preferences for language use, particularly in its humor, imaginative descriptions, and use of irony and sarcasm. Story A, while competent, does not reach the same level of alignment in these areas.  \n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 3  \nStory B: 5  \n</score>  ",

            "1": "<thinking>  \n**Story A Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Unexpected Twists or Revelations**: Story A incorporates a twist with the revelation that Earth might have once had dragons, which challenges the initial assumption that Earth is dragon-less. This aligns well with the author's preference for unexpected twists.\n\n2. **Humor and Irony**: The story uses some humor, particularly in the interactions between Samantha and Zorvax, but it is not heavily reliant on irony or subverting genre expectations. The humor is more subtle and situational.\n\n3. **Resolution through Dialogue and Character Interaction**: The story resolves its central conflict through dialogue and character interaction, particularly between Samantha and Zorvax, as they decide to embark on a quest together. This aligns well with the author's preference.\n\n4. **Moral or Philosophical Reflection**: The story includes a philosophical reflection on the loss of dragons and the potential to bring them back, which aligns with the author's preference for including such reflections in the resolution.\n\n5. **Circular Plot Structure**: The story does not employ a circular plot structure. It begins with a conversation in a caf\u00e9 and ends with a journey to find the Draconis Stone, without returning to the initial setting or situation.\n\nOverall, Story A aligns well with several of the author's preferences, particularly in terms of unexpected twists, resolution through dialogue, and philosophical reflection, but it lacks a circular plot structure and strong use of humor and irony.\n\n**Story B Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Unexpected Twists or Revelations**: Story B does not have a significant twist or revelation. The story maintains a consistent theme of Zephyr's disbelief and exploration of Earth without dragons.\n\n2. **Humor and Irony**: The story uses humor effectively, particularly in Zephyr's interactions with Lucy and their misunderstanding of Earth's mundane elements as potential dragons. This aligns well with the author's preference for humor and irony.\n\n3. **Resolution through Dialogue and Character Interaction**: The story resolves through dialogue and interaction between Zephyr and Lucy, as they explore the museum and discuss the possibility of introducing dragons to Earth. This aligns with the author's preference.\n\n4. **Moral or Philosophical Reflection**: The story lacks a strong moral or philosophical reflection. It focuses more on the humorous and whimsical aspects of Zephyr's experience.\n\n5. **Circular Plot Structure**: The story does not employ a circular plot structure. It begins with Zephyr's arrival and ends with the idea of bringing dragons to Earth, without returning to the initial setting or situation.\n\nOverall, Story B aligns well with the author's preference for humor and resolution through dialogue, but it lacks unexpected twists, a strong moral reflection, and a circular plot structure.\n\n**Conclusion**: Story A aligns more closely with the author's preferences in terms of plot, particularly with its unexpected twist and philosophical reflection, while Story B excels in humor but lacks other elements.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 4  \nStory B: 3  \n</score>  ",

            "1": "<thinking>  \n**Story A Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Blending Fantasy and Reality**: Story A effectively blends elements of fantasy and reality by introducing a universe where dragons are real and integral to planetary ecosystems, while Earth is portrayed as a planet that has forgotten its dragons. The interstellar caf\u00e9 setting and the interaction between Samantha and Zorvax create a believable yet fantastical world.\n\n2. **Reinterpreting Supernatural Creatures**: The story reinterprets dragons in a unique way, presenting them as ecological regulators and pollinators, which is an unconventional take on the traditional fire-breathing dragon trope.\n\n3. **Use of Humor**: There is a subtle use of humor in the interaction between Samantha and Zorvax, particularly in the disbelief and cultural misunderstandings about dragons, but it is not a dominant feature of the story.\n\n4. **Modern Cultural References**: The story lacks explicit modern cultural references, focusing more on the fantastical elements and the quest narrative.\n\n5. **Theme of Identity and Transformation**: The story touches on the theme of identity and transformation through the idea of rediscovering Earth's lost dragons and the potential for their return, which could transform Earth's ecosystem and culture.\n\nOverall, Story A aligns well with the author's preferences for creativity, particularly in its unique reinterpretation of dragons and the blending of fantasy and reality.\n\n**Story B Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Blending Fantasy and Reality**: Story B also blends fantasy and reality by introducing Zephyr, an alien from a dragon-populated planet, to Earth, where dragons are absent. The setting in a bustling city and the interactions with Lucy ground the story in reality while exploring fantastical elements.\n\n2. **Reinterpreting Supernatural Creatures**: The story reinterprets dragons by comparing them to Earth's mundane creatures like pigeons and dogs, and later to dinosaurs, which adds a humorous twist to the traditional dragon narrative.\n\n3. **Use of Humor**: Humor is more prominent in Story B, particularly in Zephyr's incredulous reactions to Earth's lack of dragons and the comparisons to pigeons and dogs. This aligns well with the author's preference for using humor to subvert genre conventions.\n\n4. **Modern Cultural References**: The story includes modern cultural references, such as satellites, cars, and the Natural History Museum, which add a contemporary twist to the theme of dragons.\n\n5. **Theme of Identity and Transformation**: The theme of identity and transformation is explored through Zephyr's plan to reintroduce dragons to Earth, suggesting a potential transformation of Earth's culture and environment.\n\nStory B aligns strongly with the author's preferences for creativity, particularly in its humorous reinterpretation of dragons, use of modern cultural references, and exploration of transformation.\n\n**Conclusion**: Both stories align well with the author's preferences for creativity, but Story B demonstrates a stronger alignment due to its effective use of humor and modern cultural references, alongside the creative reinterpretation of dragons.\n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 4  \nStory B: 5  \n</score>  ",

        "Development (Character and Setting)": {
            "1": "<thinking>  \nIn evaluating the two stories based on the \"Development (Character and Setting)\" category from the Author Writing Sheet, we need to consider several aspects: character development through dialogue, the use of character interactions to reveal deeper themes, the creation of immersive settings, the use of contrasting character dynamics, and the portrayal of characters out of their depth.\n\n**Story A:**\n\n1. **Character Development through Dialogue**: Story A effectively uses witty and humorous dialogue to develop characters. Zephyr's incredulity and Lucy's bemusement are conveyed through their exchanges, which reveal their personalities and cultural differences.\n\n2. **Character Interactions and Themes**: The interactions between Zephyr and Lucy subtly explore themes of cultural exchange and understanding. Zephyr's struggle to comprehend a world without dragons highlights the theme of adapting to new environments.\n\n3. **Immersive Settings**: The setting blends the ordinary (New York City) with the extraordinary (Zephyr's perspective of a dragon-filled world). This contrast creates an immersive experience as Zephyr navigates a mundane world with a sense of wonder.\n\n4. **Contrasting Character Dynamics**: The dynamic between Zephyr, an alien accustomed to dragons, and Lucy, an Earthling, drives the narrative. Their contrasting worldviews are central to the story's progression.\n\n5. **Characters Out of Their Depth**: Zephyr is clearly out of their depth on Earth, leading to humorous and insightful situations as they try to understand a dragon-less world.\n\n**Story B:**\n\n1. **Character Development through Dialogue**: Story B also uses dialogue to develop characters, particularly through Zorvax's explanations and Samantha's curiosity. However, the dialogue is more expository and less humorous compared to Story A.\n\n2. **Character Interactions and Themes**: The story explores themes of discovery and adventure through the quest for the Draconis Stone. The interactions between Zorvax and Samantha reveal a shared sense of purpose and curiosity.\n\n3. **Immersive Settings**: The setting is vividly described, especially the interstellar caf\u00e9 and the moon Gorgath-9. The blend of science fiction elements with the quest for dragons creates an engaging backdrop.\n\n4. **Contrasting Character Dynamics**: The dynamic between Zorvax, an alien with knowledge of dragons, and Samantha, a human intrigued by the possibility of their existence, is central to the story. However, the contrast is less pronounced than in Story A.\n\n5. **Characters Out of Their Depth**: Samantha is portrayed as out of her depth in the alien environment, leading to a sense of adventure and discovery. However, the focus is more on the quest than on her personal struggle.\n\nOverall, Story A aligns more closely with the author's preferences for character and setting development, particularly in its use of humor, contrasting dynamics, and the portrayal of characters out of their depth. Story B, while strong in setting and thematic exploration, is less aligned with the author's preference for humor and contrasting character dynamics.\n\n</thinking>  \n\n<score>  \nStory A: 5  \nStory B: 4  \n</score>  ",
