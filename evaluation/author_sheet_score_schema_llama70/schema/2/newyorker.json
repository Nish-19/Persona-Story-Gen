The narrative is structured around the everyday challenge of a writer trying to please his mother, using this as a backdrop for exploring deeper themes. The conflict is introduced through the systemic challenge of meeting his mother's expectations, rather than personal antagonism. The resolution, while ultimately happy, is nuanced and open to interpretation, reflecting the complexity of real-life situations. The writer's journey, as he navigates his mother's critiques and his own creative vision, is a powerful exploration of the writing process and the search for artistic integrity. The story's use of ambiguity, particularly in the ending, adds depth and complexity, making it a strong fit for the author's preferences.\n\nStory B, while engaging and well-written, deviates from the author's preferences in several key areas. The narrative is more traditional, with a clearer hero's journey arc, and the conflict is introduced through personal doubts and fears rather than systemic challenges. The resolution, while hopeful and uplifting, feels more contrived and less nuanced than Story A's. The story's themes, while relatable, are not as deeply explored as in Story A, and the narrative relies more on familiar tropes and plot devices. While the story is well-crafted, it does not align as closely with the author's preferences for the \"Plot\" category.\n\n**score**\n\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 2",

The writer's frustration and desperation to please his mother are palpable, and the story effectively conveys the challenges of meeting someone else's expectations while staying true to one's artistic vision. The writer's imagination runs wild as he envisions fantastical scenarios for his story, which adds a layer of creativity to the narrative. However, the story's reliance on a more traditional narrative structure and character archetypes holds it back from fully embracing creativity.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, demonstrates creativity through its use of unconventional pairings of characters and themes. The story combines the writer's personal struggles with the narrative of a children's story, creating a unique blend of realism and fantasy. The character of Rosie, the brave and resourceful young rabbit, is a creative and imaginative element that adds depth to the story. The writer's use of a fairy tale as inspiration and the incorporation of themes such as perseverance and self-discovery also showcase his creative approach.\n\nIn terms of integrating imaginative elements into realistic settings, Story B excels. The writer seamlessly weaves together the world of children's literature with the real-world struggles of a writer trying to please his mother. This blending of genres and themes creates a rich and immersive narrative that is both creative and engaging.\n\nOverall, while both stories demonstrate creative elements, Story B's use of unconventional pairings, imaginative characters, and blending of genres makes it a more creative and engaging narrative.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<score>\nStory A: 3\nStory B: 5\n</score>",

Their conversations reveal their personalities, relationship, and emotional struggles, making them relatable and engaging. The story also effectively depicts the setting, using vivid descriptions of Thomas's desk, the sunlight, and the forest, which enhances the narrative's immersion. The emotional arc of Thomas's journey is well-woven, showcasing his growth and struggle to find his voice. However, the story could benefit from more nuanced character development of the supporting characters, such as Rosie, who feels somewhat one-dimensional.\n\n**Story B**\n\nStory B falls short in character development, with the writer and his mother feeling more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out characters. Their interactions, while revealing some aspects of their relationship, lack the depth and emotional resonance of Story A. The setting is also less vividly depicted, with the writer's desk and the forest feeling more like background elements than integral parts of the narrative.

The author's use of metaphors (\"the words flowed easily, pouring out of him like water from a fountain\") and sensory details (\"the sunlight streaming through the window cast a warm glow\") effectively transports the reader into the narrative.

The author conveys complex ideas, such as the struggle to please one's mother and the importance of perseverance, through simple and clear language.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, has a more inconsistent use of language. While the author attempts to create vivid imagery, the descriptions often feel forced or clich\u00e9d (\"a sea of crumpled drafts and ink-stained fingers scattered before him\"). The dialogue is sometimes stilted, with characters speaking in overly formal or expository tones. The author's use of humor and irony is limited, and the narrative often feels heavy-handed.

The ridiculous hat on the boy's head serves as a powerful symbol of his refusal to surrender to the void, and the woman's connection to it drives the narrative forward. The story also effectively explores themes of change and introspection through the characters' experiences, particularly the woman's reflections on her life choices and her sense of regret. The resolution focuses on internal realizations, as the woman finds a sense of peace and acceptance in the face of mortality. However, the story's pacing and character development are somewhat uneven, with the boy's character feeling somewhat one-dimensional.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, takes a more subtle approach to symbolism, with the boy's hat serving as a more nuanced representation of his personality and the absurdity of their situation. The story excels in its exploration of themes, particularly the connection between Emily and the boy, which is expertly woven throughout the narrative. The resolution is also well-handled, with a focus on the internal realization of Emily's connection to the boy and the sense of calm she finds in their shared experience.

The setting of the malfunctioning plane is vividly described, with details like the \"metal bird with broken wings\" and \"oxygen masks dangled from the ceiling like spectral fingers\" effectively conveying the sense of chaos and fear. The character development is extensive, with the woman's backstory and emotional state explored in detail. The boy is also given some depth, particularly in his calm demeanor and the symbolism of his ridiculous hat. However, the story sometimes feels overly introspective, with long passages dedicated to the woman's thoughts that, while insightful, slow the pace of the narrative.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, strikes a better balance between character development and plot progression. Emily's fear and desperation are palpable as she navigates the terrifying situation, and her connection with the boy is heartfelt and believable. The setting is also well-described, with the \"eerie blue glow of the cabin lights\" and \"bright yellow\" oxygen masks creating a vivid image.

The protagonist's emotional complexity is skillfully woven throughout the narrative, particularly in their struggles to understand the strange occurrences in the house and their own feelings of unease. The setting of the wedge-shaped house and the Triangle Zone is vividly described, and its influence on the protagonist's emotional state is palpable. The house is depicted as a character in its own right, with its own secrets and whispers that reflect the protagonist's inner world. The story effectively explores the interplay between the protagonist's internal state and the external environment, creating a rich and immersive narrative.\n\nStory B, while engaging and well-written, falls short in its character development. The protagonist and Rachel are not as deeply explored as in Story A, and their emotional journeys are not as nuanced. The setting of the Triangle Zone is well-described, but its influence on the characters' emotional states is not as pronounced. The story relies more on plot twists and supernatural elements, which, while intriguing, do not delve as deeply into the characters' inner lives.

The story revolves around Nurse Emma's daily routine at the hospice, which escalates to a dramatic climax when she takes Mr. Jenkins to the garden. The conflict is introduced through the mundane domestic issue of Mr. Jenkins' impending death, which leads to a tragic resolution. However, the story also explores the theme of hope and the impact of small moments on the patients' lives. The plot is well-structured, and the escalation to the climax is well-executed.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, employs a more non-linear narrative structure, jumping between different scenes and characters. The conflict is introduced through the domestic issue of Mrs. Jenkins' terminal illness, but it is not as central to the plot as it is in Story A. Instead, the story focuses on Emma's journey as she navigates the hospice and discovers the garden, which becomes a symbol of hope and resilience. The plot is more character-driven, and the story explores the themes of hope, mortality, and the human spirit.\n\nIn terms of alignment with the Author Writing Sheet, Story A scores higher in terms of structuring the story around a repetitive routine that escalates to a dramatic climax (point 1). The story effectively uses the daily routine to build tension and create a sense of inevitability, which is released in the climax. However, the story does not introduce conflict through a mundane domestic issue that leads to a tragic resolution (point 2) as explicitly as Story B does.\n\nStory B scores higher in terms of introducing conflict through a mundane domestic issue that leads to a tragic resolution (point 2).

The author uses the character of Nurse Emma to create a sense of hope and light, highlighting her small actions and interactions with the patients as a way to bring comfort and joy to those around her. The story also employs the use of symbolism, particularly with the garden, to represent the resilience of hope and the human spirit. The author's use of repetition, such as Emma's daily visits to the garden and her interactions with the patients, emphasizes the theme of communication breakdown and the importance of human connection in creating light in the darkness.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, takes a more introspective approach, focusing on the emotional journey of the protagonist, Emma, as she navigates the hospice and grapples with the weight of her grandmother's mortality. The author uses the garden as a catalyst for Emma's growth and self-discovery, highlighting the ways in which the natural world can bring solace and peace to those in need. The story also employs a more lyrical and poetic tone, using vivid descriptions of the garden and the characters to create a sense of atmosphere and mood. The author's use of imagery and symbolism, such as the wildflowers and the sunlight, adds depth and complexity to the narrative, highlighting the themes of hope, resilience, and the human spirit.\n\nIn terms of creativity, both stories demonstrate a high level of originality and innovation in their approach to the theme. However, Story B stands out for its more nuanced and introspective exploration of the human experience, and its use of lyrical language to convey the emotional depth of the characters.

However, the approach and execution differ, leading to varying degrees of alignment with the author's preferences.\n\nStory A excels in developing characters through their interactions and responses to a shared routine. The narrative delves into the daily life of Nurse Emma, showcasing her interactions with patients, particularly Mr. Jenkins, and her efforts to create moments of hope and light in the hospice. The story effectively establishes an immersive setting confined to the domestic space of the hospice, highlighting the themes of isolation and disconnect. The author skillfully weaves together the characters' stories, creating a sense of community and shared experience among the patients and staff. The garden, introduced as a small oasis, serves as a powerful symbol of hope and resilience, further enriching the setting.\n\nStory B also develops characters through their interactions, but with a stronger focus on the emotional journeys of the characters. The narrative centers around Emma's relationship with her grandmother, Mrs. Jenkins, and their experiences in the hospice. The story effectively explores the emotional depth of the characters, particularly Emma's growth as she navigates her role as a caregiver and confronts the reality of her grandmother's mortality.

The plot is driven by dialogue, with each character's perspective weaving together to form a rich and nuanced exploration of identity. The story's cyclical structure, where the narrative ends in a similar setting as it began, adds to the sense of introspection and contemplation.

The story unfolds through a non-linear timeline, jumping between Emma's past and present. This structure aligns with the author's preference for reflective narratives (point 1 in the Author Writing Sheet).

Their histories and relationships are skillfully revealed, showcasing the depth of their bond and the weight of their differences. The setting, particularly the abyss and the wall, effectively reflects the characters' emotional states and thematic elements, such as the chasm of their discord and the barriers they've erected. The use of secondary characters, like Alex, highlights the protagonists' traits and conflicts, adding depth to the narrative. The story also portrays characters at a crossroads, facing decisions that reflect broader life themes, such as the struggle to understand and connect with others despite deep-seated differences. However, the character development, while strong, sometimes feels slightly overshadowed by the thematic elements and the dreamlike setting.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, focuses more on the emotional and psychological development of the characters, particularly Lena and Max. The dreamlike setting serves as a backdrop for exploring their inner worlds, desires, and conflicts. The wall and the abyss are potent symbols of their emotional states, and the story effectively uses these elements to reflect their inner struggles. The characters' interactions and dialogue are more subdued, yet still revealing, and the story does an excellent job of portraying them at a crossroads, grappling with the consequences of their differences.

The story revolves around Emilia's antique shop, where she preserves memories and artifacts from Ashwood's past. The conflict is introduced through the woman's search for a photograph of her grandmother, which sparks a deeper exploration of the past and its significance. The resolution is more defined, as Emilia and the woman form a connection over their shared memories, and the photograph becomes a symbol of their resistance against the erasure of history.\n\nIn contrast, Story B adopts a more introspective and philosophical approach, with the narrator's memories serving as the primary driving force. The narrative is structured around the narrator's recollections of their grandmother's stories and the weight of memory. The conflict is introduced through the narrator's internal contemplation, as they grapple with the burden of remembering and the importance of resistance. The resolution is more open-ended, inviting the reader to ponder the significance of memory and its role in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our collective history.\n\nConsidering the Author Writing Sheet, Story B aligns more closely with the author's preferences for plot structure, as it prioritizes introspective and philosophical musings over traditional plot progression. The conflict is introduced through internal contemplation, and the resolution is left open-ended, encouraging the reader to reflect on the deeper meanings.

However, the extent to which each story aligns with these preferences varies.\n\nStory A excels in its creative blending of the mundane with the mystical, as seen in the vivid descriptions of the library and the protagonist's memories. The story also effectively reinterprets the prompt through a philosophical lens, exploring the abstract concept of memory as a form of resistance. The integration of historical and personal memories is also well-done, with the protagonist's memories of their grandmother's stories about the civil rights movement adding depth to the narrative. However, the story's creativity is somewhat hindered by its reliance on more traditional narrative structures and imagery.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, showcases a more innovative approach to creativity. The story's use of the antique shop as a repository of memories and relics is a unique and captivating concept. The way the narrative weaves together the past and present, using the photograph as a catalyst for the protagonist's memories, is also highly creative. The story's philosophical lens is more subtle, but no less effective, as it explores the idea of memory as a form of resistance through the protagonist's actions and emotions.

The setting of the library is vividly depicted as an extension of the protagonist's internal state, with the \"whispers of forgotten stories\" and \"the flickering fluorescent lights\" creating an immersive atmosphere that enhances the introspective tone. The author's focus on the emotional and philosophical significance of the setting, rather than physical description, effectively conveys the protagonist's connection to the past and their role as a keeper of memories. The character's development is deeply rooted in their internal world, making their emotions and thoughts the driving force behind the narrative.\n\nIn contrast, Story B develops its characters and setting through a more subtle and nuanced approach. Emilia, the protagonist, is portrayed through her actions and interactions with the young woman, revealing her character through her reverence for the past and her role as a guardian of memories. The setting of the antique shop is richly detailed, with the \"scent of old books and decay\" and the \"dusty cabinet\" creating a vivid image of a space where the past and present converge. However, the author's focus on the physical description of the setting, while evocative, sometimes overshadows the emotional and philosophical significance of the space. The character development is more implicit, relying on the reader to infer Emilia's emotions and thoughts from her actions and the narrative.\n\nConsidering the Author Writing Sheet's emphasis on developing characters through internal thoughts and reflections, and settings as extensions of the protagonist's internal state, Story A aligns more closely with these preferences. Story B, while effective in its own right, deviates slightly from these guidelines, relying more on action and physical description to convey character and setting.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<score>\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 3\n</score>",

The narrative raises philosophical questions, albeit more subtly, through Emilia's realization that \"the act of remembering... was not merely a passive recollection but an active resistance against the erasure of history.\" Metaphorical language is used sparingly, but effectively, as in the comparison of memories to \"threads in a larger tapestry.\"\n\n</thinking>\n\n<score>\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 4\n</score>",

The narrative's fluidity is enhanced by the use of descriptive language, which creates a vivid atmosphere and immerses the reader in the desolate alley. The conflict is introduced through the surreal and fantastical elements of the woman's presence, which challenges Victor's perceptions of reality. The story's resolution is ambiguous, leaving the reader questioning the reality of events and the nature of the woman's intentions. The existential theme of the absurdity of life is also present, as Victor's world is turned upside down by the encounter.\n\nIn contrast, Story B employs a more linear narrative structure, with Vega waiting for instructions from his boss, Phoenix, and encountering the mysterious woman. While the story introduces conflict through the woman's enigmatic presence and her knowledge of Vega's business, it resolves the narrative with a more concrete conclusion, as Vega is left to ponder the woman's words and the blurring of lines between predator and prey.

However, the execution and depth of these elements vary between the two stories.\n\nStory A excels in developing Jasper, the puppeteer, through his internal monologues and reflections, showcasing his struggles with the weight of his troupe's financial woes and his own creative doubts.

However, the narrative sometimes feels more focused on the mystery surrounding Mrs. Klein's death, slightly overshadowing the deep emotional complexity of the characters.\n\n**score**\n\nStory A: 4\nStory B: 4",

The narrative is rich in sensory details, such as the \"high ceilings and polished hardwood floors\" of the apartment, the \"thrill of excitement\" Romi feels as she envisions her life unfolding, and the \"faint thud\" of Mrs. Jenkins's body hitting the ground. The use of sensory language effectively creates an immersive atmosphere, drawing the reader into Romi's world.\n\nIn contrast, Story B's language is more subdued, with fewer sensory details. While the narrative still effectively conveys Romi's emotions and thoughts, it lacks the vividness and depth of Story A's language. For example, the description of the apartment is more generic, with phrases like \"elegant curve of the staircase\" and \"soft glow of the chandelier.\" While these descriptions are pleasant, they do not evoke the same level of sensory detail as Story A.\n\nRegarding dialogue, both stories effectively use conversation to reveal character emotions and tensions. However, Story A's dialogue feels more natural and spontaneous, with a better balance between dialogue and narration. In Story B, the dialogue sometimes feels forced or expository, with characters explaining their thoughts and feelings in a way that feels unnatural.\n\nFinally, both stories feature a reflective and introspective narrative voice, but Story A's voice is more consistent and effective in conveying Romi's inner world. The narrative voice in Story A is more lyrical and expressive, with phrases like \"the apartment seemed to hum with possibility\" and \"the shadows seemed to twist and writhe on the walls.\" In contrast, Story B's narrative voice is more straightforward and lacks the same level of lyricality.\n\n**score**\n\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 3",

The narrative is structured around a central existential question, \"What if the absence of color reveals the true hues of our existence?\" which drives the plot and the protagonist's reflections. The conflict is introduced through the protagonist's internal struggle to understand the significance of the gray corner and its implications for a world that has forgotten how to live without color. The narrative resolution is achieved through philosophical insight, as the protagonist comes to understand the true meaning of the gray corner and its connection to the human soul. The story's focus on the protagonist's introspection and the exploration of the gray corner's secrets creates a contemplative and thought-provoking atmosphere, aligning with the author's preference for a narrative that drives the plot through the protagonist's reflections.\n\nIn contrast, Story B does not as closely align with the author's preferences for the \"Plot\" category. While the narrative does explore the theme of a world that has forgotten how to live without color, the plot is driven more by external events, such as Ava's discovery of the gray corner and her interactions with the old woman, rather than the protagonist's internal struggles. The conflict is also introduced through external events, such as the contrast between the colorful world and the gray corner, rather than the protagonist's internal struggles. The narrative resolution is achieved through Ava's newfound understanding of the past and her connection to it, but it is not as deeply rooted in philosophical insight as Story A. The story's focus on Ava's discovery and her interactions with the old woman creates a more action-driven narrative, which does not as closely align with the author's preference for a narrative that drives the plot through the protagonist's reflections.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<score>\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 2\n</score>",

However, the alignment with the author's preferences for creativity, which includes employing dark humor to explore existential themes, blending elements of the supernatural with introspective narrative, and reinterpreting the concept of life after death as a platform for self-realization, varies between the two stories.\n\nStory A delves into the theme of a world governed by color, exploring the concept of rebellion through the preservation of a gray corner in an old woman's apartment. While it touches on the idea of a world that has forgotten its past and the importance of memories, it does not strongly incorporate elements of dark humor, the supernatural, or reinterpretation of life after death. The narrative is more grounded in a realistic, albeit dystopian, setting and focuses on the emotional and psychological aspects of the characters. The creativity in Story A lies in its exploration of a unique world and the emotional depth it brings to the theme of rebellion and memory.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, takes a more philosophical approach, using the gray corner as a metaphor for the authenticity and simplicity that can be found in a world dominated by color. It explores the idea that the absence of color can reveal the true hues of existence, touching on themes of self-realization and the depths of the human soul. While it does not explicitly incorporate dark humor or the supernatural, it does reinterpret the concept of existence in a colorful world, offering a unique perspective on what it means to live without color. The creativity in Story B is evident in its use of the gray corner as a portal to the past and a window to the soul, and in its exploration of the idea that true vibrancy comes from within.\n\n**score**\n\nStory A: 3\nStory B: 4",

However, the depth and effectiveness of this development vary between the two narratives.\n\nStory A excels in developing its protagonist through introspection and self-awareness. The protagonist's journey from curiosity to understanding and acceptance is well-documented, and the story effectively uses the setting of the gray corner to symbolize the protagonist's internal state. The emotional arc of the protagonist is clear, moving from a state of wonder to a deeper understanding of the world and themselves. The setting of Chromville and the concept of the Color Distribution law are also well-developed, serving as a backdrop that highlights the protagonist's journey. The story effectively uses the contrast between the vibrant city and the gray corner to reflect the protagonist's growth and newfound appreciation for the simplicity and authenticity of the past.\n\nStory B also attempts to develop its protagonist, Ava, through her discovery of the gray corner and the stories it holds. However, Ava's character development feels somewhat less nuanced compared to the protagonist in Story A. While Ava's curiosity and desire to understand the past are relatable, her emotional arc is not as clearly defined. The setting of the colorful world and the gray corner is well-described, but it doesn't serve as a direct reflection of Ava's internal state in the same way it does in Story A. The story does, however, effectively use the contrast between the vibrant city and the gray corner to highlight the themes of memory, humanity, and the importance of remembering the past.\n\nGiven these observations, I would score Story A a 5 in terms of development, as it effectively develops both the protagonist and the setting in a way that aligns closely with the author's preferences outlined in the Author Writing Sheet. Story B, while attempting to develop its protagonist and setting, falls slightly short in terms of nuance and direct alignment with the author's preferences, earning it a score of 3.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<score>\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 3\n</score>",

Both stories demonstrate a strong command of language, but their alignment with the author's preferences varies.\n\nStory A excels in its use of vivid, sensory imagery, creating an immersive experience for the reader. The description of the gray corner, with its \"soft whispers of dust settling on the untouched surfaces\" and \"gentle embrace of shadows,\" effectively transports the reader to the scene. The narrative also employs a conversational tone, engaging the reader directly and fostering a sense of connection with the protagonist. The use of rhetorical questions, such as \"What if the absence of color reveals the true hues of our existence?\" encourages reflection and adds depth to the narrative. Furthermore, the story incorporates repetition, emphasizing the significance of the gray corner and its impact on the protagonist. Metaphorical language, like \"the gray corner had become a part of me, a reminder of the beauty of simplicity, of authenticity,\" conveys complex emotional states and reinforces the story's themes.\n\nIn contrast, Story B, while also rich in sensory details, focuses more on the emotional resonance of the gray corner. The narrative effectively conveys the protagonist's introspection and curiosity, drawing the reader into Ava's world. The story employs a more subdued tone, which suits the themes of nostalgia and remembrance. However, the use of rhetorical questions is less prominent, and the narrative relies more on descriptive passages to convey the significance of the gray corner. The story does incorporate repetition, emphasizing the importance of memories and the human connection to the past. Metaphorical language is used sparingly, but effectively, as in the description of the gray corner as a \"reminder of what truly makes us human.\"\n\n**score**\n\nStory A: 5\nStory B: 4",

The conflict is introduced through the protagonist's inner turmoil, and the story resolves with the protagonist choosing a non-violent path. The use of humor is evident in the absurdity of the \"Hat Act\" and the \"Truth-O-Matic 3000,\" which adds a layer of engagement to the narrative.\n\nIn contrast, Story B adopts a more traditional narrative structure, with a focus on character development and atmospheric setting. The conflict is introduced through the protagonist's past actions and the new president's regime, and the story resolves with the protagonist contemplating a return to his past life. The narrative is more subtle in its approach, relying on the protagonist's introspection and the conversations with Carlos and the journalist to drive the plot.\n\nConsidering the Author Writing Sheet's emphasis on a persuasive letter format, customer dissatisfaction, and humor, Story A aligns more closely with these preferences. The narrative structure and use of humor effectively engage the reader and drive the plot.

The story is a straightforward, realistic tale of a man grappling with the decision to kill again. While it is well-written and engaging, it does not employ satire, reinterpret the prompt in a creative way, or integrate imaginative product features.

The story employs satire to critique the absurdity of the tyrannical regime, particularly in the form of the \"Hat Act\" and the \"Truth-O-Matic 3000.\" The narrative also creatively reinterprets the prompt by focusing on the assassin's inner conflict and his use of a bizarre device to gather intel. The integration of imaginative product features, such as the Truth-O-Matic 3000, adds to the story's absurdity and creativity.

The use of descriptive language, such as \"the rain-soaked streets of Buenos Aires\", \"the aroma of freshly brewed coffee\", and \"the spark within him burning bright\", effectively establishes the setting and immerses the reader in the world of the story. The character of Leonardo is developed through his interactions with Carlos and the young woman, revealing his past, his motivations, and his inner conflict. The narrative also effectively conveys the atmosphere of the city, the tension, and the sense of foreboding, making the setting a character in its own right.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, falls short in developing the character and setting. The narrative is presented in a letter format, which, while unique, limits the opportunity for descriptive language and immersive setting development. The character of the protagonist is somewhat one-dimensional, with their thoughts and feelings expressed mainly through their inner monologue. The setting is barely described, with only a few mentions of the country and the President's decrees.
