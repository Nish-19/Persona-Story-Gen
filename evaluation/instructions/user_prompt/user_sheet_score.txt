  - 1 indicates minimal alignment with the user's preferences for the category.
  - 5 indicates strong alignment with the user's preferences for the category.  
- **Impartiality**: Avoid any position biases; ensure that the order in which the stories are presented does not influence your decision.  
- **Focus**: Assess each story based solely on how well it aligns with the user's preferences for the specified category.
