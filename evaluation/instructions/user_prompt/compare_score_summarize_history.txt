### Guidelines for Evaluation

- **Impartiality**: Avoid any positional biases; ensure that the order in which the stories are presented does not influence your decision.  
- **Length Independence**: Do not let the length of the responses affect your evaluation.  
- **Objectivity**: Focus solely on similarity to the **Author Style Summary** based on the specified storytelling aspect.  
- **Similarity Criteria**: Base your judgment on how well the Assistant stories align with the author’s storytelling style as described in the **Author Style Summary** for the **Evaluation Aspect**.  
- **Score Clarity**: Provide clear and well-supported reasoning for the scores assigned to each story.
