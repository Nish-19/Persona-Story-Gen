### Guidelines for Evaluation

- **Impartiality**: Avoid any positional biases; ensure that the order in which the stories are presented does not influence your decision.  
- **Length Independence**: Do not let the length of the responses affect your evaluation.  
- **Objectivity**: Focus solely on similarity to the Human-Written Story (author history) based on the specified storytelling aspect.  
- **Similarity Criteria**: Base your judgment on how well the Assistant stories align with the Human-Written Story in terms of the **Evaluation Aspect**.  
- **Score Clarity**: Provide clear and well-supported reasoning for the scores assigned to each story.

### Evaluation Instructions  

### Input  

You will receive (as a Python Dictionary):  
1. A **Previous Writing Prompt** and its corresponding **Human-Written Story** (reference) written by the author.  
2. A **New Writing Prompt** that the Assistant stories are based on.  
3. Two **Assistant stories** (**Assistant A** and **Assistant B**) written for the new writing prompt.  

Your task is to:  
1. **Independently analyze** the Human-Written Story (from the previous prompt), Assistant A's story, and Assistant B's story based on the **specified storytelling aspect**.
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of each storyâ€™s alignment with the storytelling aspect.
2. **Evaluate the similarities** between each Assistant story and the Human-Written Story for the storytelling aspect.
   - Discuss how well each Assistant story aligns with the Human-Written Story (author history) in style, execution, and adherence to the storytelling aspect.
3. **Score** the similarity of each Assistant story to the Human-Written Story.
   - Assign a score between 1 and 5 to each Assistant story.
