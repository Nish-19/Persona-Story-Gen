### Guidelines for Evaluation  

- **Impartiality**: Avoid any position biases; ensure that the order in which the stories are presented does not influence your decision.  
- **Length**: Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation.  
- **Objectivity**: Be objective and focus solely on similarity to the human-written story and adherence to the writing prompt.  
- **Winner Selection**: You must always select a winner, based on the story that most closely matches the human-written reference.

# Evaluation Instructions  

### Input  

You will receive (as a Python Dictionary):  
1. A **Writing Prompt** that all stories are based on.  
2. A **Human-Written Story** (reference) written in response to the writing prompt.  
3. Two **candidate stories** (**Assistant A** and **Assistant B**).  

Your task is to:  
1. Compare each candidate story against the human-written reference, analyzing them based on the specified storytelling aspects and adherence to the writing prompt.  
2. Determine which candidate's story is more aligned with the reference story and writing prompt.  

### Evaluation Aspects  

1. **Plot**: Assess whether the candidate stories follow a similar structure, progression, and coherence to the human-written story. Evaluate the clarity of the beginning, middle, and end, as well as the logical flow of events.  
2. **Creativity**: Evaluate the originality and alignment of ideas, themes, and imagery with the human-written story and prompt. Check if tropes or creative elements are used in a way that mirrors the human-written style.  
3. **Character and Setting Development**: Consider how well the candidate stories develop their characters and settings, including depth, detail, and consistency with the human-written story and prompt.  
4. **Language Use**: Judge the effectiveness of sentence structure, tone, and stylistic choices. Evaluate whether the language aligns with the human-written storyâ€™s tone, mood, and overall style.  

### Output Format

Clearly explain the reasoning for your decision. -->  
</evaluation>
