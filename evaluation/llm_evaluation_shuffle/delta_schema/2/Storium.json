The use of sensory details, such as the \"rain-streaked window\" and the \"flickering neon sign,\" effectively immerses the reader in the atmosphere.

The protagonist's introspection and self-doubt are palpable, making his journey more relatable and engaging. The story also effectively conveys the sense of mystery and anticipation surrounding the green light, which serves as a symbol of hope and transformation. The writing is more lyrical and evocative, with phrases like \"the light pulsed gently, as if breathing\" creating a dreamlike atmosphere.
