    "User": "Story: My father had always been the kind of man who patted you on the back instead of saying I love you. The kind of man who'd said 'interesting' when he'd accidentally put a screwdriver through his hand. The kind of man that, on their wedding day, told my mother she 'looked very nice.'\n\nHe saw me walk into the room and screamed. \"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!\"\n\nI stopped in the doorway as he threw his copy of automotive magazine across the room and slapped his hands down on the couch cushions. After a second, he pinched his nose and I heard him swear over and over and over.\n\nI'd come to the living room to apologize for breaking his 'house rule', but this was not the reaction I'd expected.\n\nMy mom was the polar opposite of my father, they'd been attracted like magnets. She was the kind of woman who texted hearts 37 times an afternoon. The kind of woman who said nothing on her wedding day because she was busy blubbering. The kind of woman who...\n\nActually her pain tolerance was shockingly like my father's. Fancy that. Though she'd still cried when she found out swans could be gay, so the point still stood.\n\nMy mother rushed into the room skidding along the hardwood in a panic, asking what was wrong. Then she saw me in the opposite doorway. She stopped. Went silent. Then pale.\n\nDad was inconsolable. Mom needed no consoling.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked. Neither parent answered but I knew what they were going to say anyway so I spoke up for myself. \"I know you guys didn't want me to do this, but it's just for the concert and I really made sure I cleaned the shower and--\"\n\n\"She's your daughter,\" my Dad finally said.\n\n\"I think this comes from you,\" Mom spat.\n\n\"The fuck?\" I asked.\n\n\"You knew the rules young lady,\" Mom said. Since when did she take charge in discipline? \"And look what you did anyway.\"\n\n\"I dyed my hair red Mom, I can have it out in like a week if it's that big a problem.\"\n\n\"Fire truck red and she thinks she can just undo this,\" Dad sighed.\n\n\"I physically can, like right now but it'd fuck up my hair.\" Then, after a second, I turned to him, \"What the hell is going on? I came out to you like a month ago and and you just asked me if I still wanted to watch the baseball.\" I walked into the room. Dad still hadn't looked up. \"Now it's this?\"\n\n\"We didn't have a house rule against you liking girls,\" my Mom said. \"Why would we?\"\n\n\"Woulda made more sense then this stupid rule about dying hair/ Would you prefer I'd gotten a tattoo?\"\n\n\"Clearly!\" My Dad raised his voice. I jumped. Still wasn't used to that.\n\n\"Pause. Family meeting.\" I said. \"Can I grab the Talking Penguin?\" The Talking Penguin was a little statute we'd kept in the front hallway. If you were holding it, it was your turn to speak. It'd gotten us through ages 12-14.\n\nMy mom took a second, not because it looked like she needed one, but almost just because she was used to it. \"I can explain, you don't need the penguin. Herold can you grab her kit?\"\n\n\"My poor little girl,\" my Dad sighed. I raised an eyebrow as he pushed past me toward their bedroom.\n\n\"What's going on Mom?\"\n\nMy mother sighed, still eerily calm on the Janet scale. She took my Dad's place on the couch and patted for me to sit down. \"How do I explain this?\"\n\nI almost had snark for that, but I bit it down.\n\n\"Honey, we have a genetic condition in the family. It's called Main Character Syndrome. It used to be useful, but now it's just... well it's just asking for bad things to happen.\"\n\n\"Like we're shitty and self centered?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, like this.\" My dad was back in the room, dour again, and carrying a sword that I could have used as a snowboard. \"You're going to need this honey.\"\n\n\"What the hell?\" I asked. I turned to Mom, she was nodding sagely.\n\n\"You have an odd hair colour now honey, you're the main character. We're just waiting for the quest now.\"\n\n\"What quest?\" I asked.\n\n\"We don't know, but you're a teenager so it will probably start with me and your mother getting killed by someone,\" my Dad sighed. \"I knew what I was getting into when I married into this family. Love you both.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"How many stories do you read where the parents are in the picture?\" Mom asked. \"We raised you as a reader.\"\n\n\"I'm not just letting you die!\" I yelled back.\n\n\"Shouldn't have dyed your hair red,\" my Dad answered, like that made any sense, before throwing me the sword.\n\n\n\n\\n\\n\"You're. Not. Killing. My. DAD!\" I screamed in time with each strike, it helped me get more umph if I channeled emotion into my slashes. That was one of the many things I'd found out over the past days, and all of them had been useful. The mysterious stranger that'd approached the house fell backward, mostly because he was in pieces. I spat on the body and took a moment to catch my breath. Once I had air back in my lungs, I wiped some of the viscera off my face with the back of my hand. I was getting way too used to being covered in blood. Never thought that would be a habit.\n\nI prodded the man's divided arm with my toes. Still. Limp. Warm. Finally seemed like he was staying down.\n\nI spun the sword my Dad'd thrown me in the living room earlier this week. Mom'd told me to give her a name so I'd called her Olivia Rodrigo. Mom told me I needed a less copyrighted name so we dropped the Olivia. There were so many rules to being the main character. A million little things that were supposed to help me on my quest. Things to make me stronger. Things that made no sense in a world with Facebook and Snapchat, but Mom'd explained that the Main Character Syndrome came from a time when swords were normal so....\n\nThat had been most of my past week. I killed things. Mom explained things. I rolled my eyes. Rinse. Repeat. Stain the shower with red hair dye.\n\nI pulled out my phone, and texted my Mom, telling her that we were all clear outside but just when her three dots popped up I heard a squelch behind me.\n\n\"Oh my god, Bruh. Give up already!\" I sighed as I pulled Olivia Rodrigo out of the lawn. \"Just take the L.\"\n\nThe man that had stood up several times despite dismemberment was staggering back to his feet as he reassembled himself. The first time he'd walked up, he'd explained that he was going to kill my parents so that I could start my quest. The next four times, I hadn't given him time for an explanation before beginning operation limb removal. I took half a step back and shook some of the blood off my shoes.\n\n\"Why do you resist your quest?\" the man asked, his voice was rasping and broken, probably because he was still stitching his lungs back together.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe because you're trying to kill my parents?\"\n\n\"Fate will not be denied.\"\n\n\"Fate can suck my dick,\" I snapped. I lunged with Rodrigo, cutting through the air. I'd gotten fast in the past days, but the man managed to side step my blade as he twisted his spine back into place.\n\n\"You cannot continue to deny it.\"\n\n\"Dude, you're the one who keeps having to rebuild yourself,\" I pointed out, \"I'm crushing this 'denying fate' thing.\"\n\n\"You know not the forces with which you meddle.\"\n\n\"YoU kNow NOt tHe ForCES wiTh WhIch YOu MeDDle,\" I mocked.\n\nThen a sound behind me. The door opening. Mom.\n\n\"I thought you said you were done.\"\n\n\"I thought I was.\" I protested. The man went to make a move and I kept my sword pointed at him.\n\n\"Did you crush his head last time?\"\n\n\"Ew. No?\"\n\n\"You have to do that or he keeps coming back,\" my Mom explained. I checked over my shoulder. The man kept trying to find a way around the sword to get to my Mom.\n\n\"Gross.\"\n\n\"Hailey. You'll be late for dinner. Dad will clean up.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I slashed without giving the man a verbal warning this time and I caught his throat, then turned my Rodrigo to the broad side and held it up over my head. \"In my slay era I guess.\"\n\nThe splatter looked more like watermelon than I was comfortable with. Watermelon with skull in it at least.\n\nPrompt:", 
    "Assistant": "You have broken the strangest rule that your parents made, but instead of getting mad they give you a wand, a spell book for children, and a sword.  The last thing you heard from them for a while was “well, I warned you”."

    "User": "Story: \u201cMemory. As long as someone remembers me, I\u2019ll be able to come back to life.\u201d I explained, feeling everyone gaze my way. Had I said something wrong? Compared to everyone else in this room, my powers seemed underwhelming. If anything, I felt jealous of them.\n\n \n\nThe girl wearing the dragon print leather jacket was the first to speak, her nametag reading Gemma. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that make you immortal?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, great question, Gemma. Real top of the class question. Aren\u2019t you meant to be the smart one?\u201d Trax flipped Gemma off, moving to my side, hooking his arm around my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all immortal. So, yes. That makes him immortal.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t what I meant, you nincompoop. If you had two brain cells left in your constantly regenerating body, you would understand what I meant,\u201d Gemma huffed, crossing her arms over her leather jacket, glaring in my direction. I couldn\u2019t tell if she was glaring at me or Trax, but her stony stare was enough to make my shoulders slouch.\n\n \n\nLeo coughed, the skeletal man\u2019s nametag a little hard to read since it was caught between his ribs. \u201cI think she means that he\u2019s technically the most immortal of us all. We can all die if we aren\u2019t careful. If Trax\u2019s flesh is completely destroyed, he can\u2019t return. There has to be a part of him left to come back to. Gemma can die if she forgets to save after coming back to life, and I can be killed by someone breaking my curse. Gemma\u2019s trying to say that this person can\u2019t actually die.\u201d\n\n \n\nTrax released me, giving my side a poke. \u201cOh, so he thinks he\u2019s better than me?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat? I never said that.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cBut I bet you\u2019re thinking it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cTrax, stop it. He\u2019s been through enough. Don\u2019t scare him.\u201d Leo pulled Trax away, leaving me alone on the opposite side of the room. I felt naked, standing before three immortals who didn\u2019t seem that fond of me.\n\n \n\n\u201cHow does your power work? Please explain it to the best of your abilities.\u201d Gemma requested.\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, when I die. I go back to someone\u2019s memory of me. Sorry, I don\u2019t understand the specifics of it.\u201d\n\n \n\nGemma sighed. \u201cFigured you wouldn\u2019t. No one ever understands the specifics of their powers. I\u2019m still not sure how mine works.\u201d\n\n \n\nTrax grinned, flaunting himself through the room, hands raised in the air like a champion boxer who had delivered the knockout blow. \u201cSpeak for yourselves. I understand my powers.\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause your powers are easy-to-understand Trax.\u201d Leo said, only to lose his nerve when Trax looked his way. \u201cI mean, regeneration is a more commonly recognized form of immortality and\u2026.. I\u2019ll stop speaking now.\u201d\n\n \n\n \u201cGood choice.\u201d Trax sat himself down on a bunk-bed, swinging his legs after he did. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the chosen one. The messiah. The one that will be picked?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cPicked? Where am I?\u201d It felt odd to ask such a question this late into the conversation, but they had bombarded me with information. This was the first chance I had to think for myself. \u201cDid I get kidnapped?\u201d\n\n \n\nLooking around the room, I took in my surroundings. Bunk beds, tv\u2019s, a bathroom, small kitchen and some game consoles. It wasn\u2019t exactly a prison, and yet it didn\u2019t feel homely either. Like someone was doing their best to simulate what a home should be.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe lady said she had a few questions to ask us. Nothing sinister, she promised. Though I\u2019ve never been kidnapped for a questionnaire before.\u201d Gemma said.\n\n \n\n\u201cI assumed someone was going to kill me. People don\u2019t like monsters like myself.\u201d Leo whined.\n\n \n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like looking at you either. It\u2019s creepy seeing a skeleton walk around. Makes me feel like mine\u2019s going to crawl out of my body.\u201d Trax saw Gemma\u2019s frustrated stare, throwing his arms up in response. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t care if it hurts his feelings and stop saying kidnapped. We aren\u2019t children. It\u2019s adultnapped.\u201d\n\n \n\nGemma shook her head. \u201cHave you always been this stupid, or does it get worse after every death? I\u2019m only half jesting too. Part of me wants to know.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, go load a save you bitch. Wait, why are you here? Can\u2019t you escape? Same goes for you photographs. Why are you both here?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, I would have to die to escape. I also don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m in danger.\u201d I said.\n\n \n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you're scared of dying? It only hurts the first three times. After that, you get used to it. No worse than getting a needle. Guess we should all just wait then.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Leo asked, looking at me.\n\n \n\n\u201cKen. Nice to meet you.\u201d I said, realizing I didn\u2019t have a nametag of my own. Maybe it was because I was the newest one here?\n\n \n\nThe door opened to the room, and a woman entered, dressed in a coffee stain covered lab coat. She sat herself on the couch and smiled. \u201cEveryone\u2019s finally here. I\u2019m Dr. Marue. Before you ask, no, I don\u2019t plan to kill you or experiment on you. I\u2019m only here to ask you a few questions.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat? You couldn\u2019t book a phone interview or send them by mail?\u201d Trax asked, pointing to the door she had entered through. \u201cAm I free to leave?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cGo right ahead. You won\u2019t be paid, though. It\u2019s a decent payday too. Five thousand each from my personal funds.\u201d\n\nTrax didn\u2019t move, kicking his feet up on the bunk-bed, laying down. \u201cNow you\u2019re speaking my language. Ok, I\u2019ll play along.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWait. Why would you kidnap us if you were planning on paying us to answer a few questions? Most of us would have agreed to come here if you explained the situation.\u201d Gemma said.\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, shut up. Who cares? She\u2019s paying us. There isn\u2019t much I wouldn\u2019t let her do to me for that sort of money.\u201d\n\n \n\nDr. Marue ignored Trax\u2019s comment. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the only one currently searching for you four. I\u2019ll be quick. You\u2019re not the only immortals we\u2019re aware of. In fact, you\u2019re four out of fifty in our database. Sadly for us, not everyone uses their powers as responsibly as you four. We need a way to kill those that take advantage of their powers. Which is where you all come in. You\u2019re our chance of finding out their weaknesses. Now, I proposed we do that by asking questions. The other members of my team wanted to cut you open. I\u2019m hoping with your answers we can find a way to stop them without resorting to such drastic measure.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe room fell silent, all of us thinking about the possibility of ending up on a lab table. That sickening feeling in my stomach not going away, even when Trax tried to lighten the mood, using his cockiness to hide his nerves.\n\n \n\n\u201cFor the right price, I\u2019ll let them cut me up.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be cut up by them. Not when their goal is to cause you as much pain as possible.\u201d\n\n \n\nAfter that, Dr. Marue took us one by one to a private room, interviewing us about our abilities. The questions were standard. When did I discover my immortality? How does it work? Any side effects? Any weaknesses? Weaknesses being the only question I had a helpful answer to.\n\n \n\n\u201cI come back as that person\u2019s memory of me. If someone thinks of me as a big crybaby. Well, that\u2019s what I come back as. Not literally, a big crybaby. But I might revert back to a sulking child until I grow up again. At least, that\u2019s my theory. I just noticed that when I came back through my mother\u2019s memories, I was a lot more handsome than I had previously been. Not to mention a lot stronger, too. Since she thought highly of me in her memories, I received those benefits.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cFasinating. So, a bad person with your abilities could weaken themselves? Or turn into a monster.\u201d She ground her teeth at that thought before guiding me to the door. \u201cThank you for your time. There\u2019s a bus waiting for you outside that will take you back into town. I apologize for the sudden questioning. I hope we can do this in a more relaxed manner next time.\u201d We shook hands and soon I was on the bus, counting the money she gave me. The bus didn\u2019t wait for the other three. Perhaps they had already been taken home while I was waiting for my turn? It was probably safer if we didn\u2019t know where each other lived. Still, I couldn\u2019t stop wondering what answers they gave as I headed home.\n\nPrompt:", 
    "Assistant": "\"So, what immortality do you have?\" \"What?\" \"Well everybody in this room has a type of immortality, I got hyper regeneration, the guy over the is a lich, the girl in leather can save and reload, and I am not bothered enough to keep talking so what is your immortality?\" \"Memory\""

    "User": "Story: # The Great Garden Robot Rescue\n\nOld habits die hard, Dr. Marcus Chen thought as he sketched modification plans for a manure spreader on his kitchen table. He\u2019d sworn off weapons design years ago, but technically, this was just agricultural equipment with... personality.\n\n\u00abGrandpa, is this where we calculate the splatter radius?\u00bb His granddaughter Lucy peered over his shoulder, her braids dangling dangerously close to his coffee cup.\n\n\u00abTrajectory analysis, Schraubenzieher,\u00bb he corrected, using his pet name for her - little screwdriver. \u00abAnd yes, we need to account for wind resistance.\u00bb\n\nIt had been two weeks since the pirates had stolen HERB. Two weeks of Lucy missing her robot friend, and two weeks of increasingly amusing reports about a garden robot driving raiders crazy with soil pH lectures.\n\nThe doorbell rang - the rest of the Tinkerers\u2018 Club had arrived for their weekly \u201equilting circle\u201c (which had produced exactly zero quilts but numerous interesting defensive patents).\n\n\u00abRight,\u00bb Old Joe said, setting down his toolbox. \u00abMartha\u2019s got the mechanical bits sorted, Doc\u2019s brought his \u201especial\u201c mixtures, and young Billy\u2019s finished reprogramming the crop drones.\u00bb\n\nMartha \u201eThe Mechanic\u201c Wilson spread out her blueprints next to Marcus\u2019s sketches. \u00abI\u2019ve modified the irrigation system. Those pirates want to steal our crops? Let\u2019s give them a proper washing first.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAnd I\u2019ve got something special brewing,\u00bb Doc Thompson added with a worrying gleam in his eye. \u00abJust need to borrow some of Joe\u2019s prize-winning compost.\u00bb\n\nLucy bounced in her seat. \u00abCan I show them my idea? Please?\u00bb\n\nMarcus nodded. His granddaughter might be twelve, but she had inherited both his engineering mind and her grandmother\u2019s mischievous streak.\n\nLucy pulled out her tablet. \u00abSo, HERB has this special protocol - Educational Override Mode. I helped program it for my science fair. When activated, he just won\u2019t stop teaching. And I mean won\u2019t stop.\u00bb\n\nThe adults exchanged glances. They\u2019d all experienced HERB\u2019s enthusiasm for horticultural education.\n\n\u00abRemember when he spent three hours explaining proper mulching techniques to the mailman?\u00bb Old Joe chuckled.\n\n\u00abThe pirates don\u2019t know about Override Mode,\u00bb Lucy continued. \u00abOne specific phrase activates it: \u201aWhat\u2019s the optimal soil pH for growing space carrots?\u2018\u00bb\n\nMarcus felt a grin spreading across his face. A grin he hadn\u2019t worn since his weapons designing days. \u00abAnd you\u2019ve taught HERB about space carrots?\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh yes,\u00bb Lucy\u2019s smile was angelic. \u00abIn great detail.\u00bb\n\nThe plan came together over cookies (Martha\u2019s) and suspicious-smelling coffee (Doc\u2019s). Each member contributed their expertise:\n\nMartha modified the grain augers to create a network of surprise transportation tubes. \u00abLike a water slide, but with more screaming,\u00bb she explained.\n\nOld Joe reprogrammed the livestock fence to create interesting patterns of static electricity. \u00abNon-lethal,\u00bb he assured them. \u00abMostly just makes their hair stand funny.\u00bb\n\nDoc\u2019s contribution smelled terrible but promised to attract every insect within fifty miles. \u00abPlus glitter,\u00bb he added. \u00abFor festive effect.\u00bb\n\nYoung Billy had turned the crop monitoring drones into a synchronized swarm. \u00abThey play the Chicken Dance,\u00bb he said proudly. \u00abWhile dispensing liquid fertilizer.\u00bb\n\nAnd Lucy? Lucy had been recording new educational content for HERB. Hours of it. About space carrots.\n\nThe pirates returned three days later. Their sensors would have shown the same sleepy farming colony - right until they landed.\n\nThe first wave of raiders met Martha\u2019s modified irrigation system. The second triggered Old Joe\u2019s electric field. The third discovered why Doc was banned from the county fair\u2019s chemical competition.\n\nAnd through it all, from the pirates\u2018 own ship, came HERB\u2019s cheerful voice: \u00abDID YOU KNOW? Space carrots require a pH balance of 6.0 to 6.5 for optimal growth! Let\u2019s discuss soil composition for the next three hours...\u00bb\n\nThe pirates lasted twenty minutes.\n\nThey returned HERB personally, along with a signed agreement to never raid the colony again. Their captain twitched slightly when Lucy asked innocently about space carrots.\n\nHERB, covered in pirate glitter and trailing happy insects, immediately began reorganizing Marcus\u2019s garden by botanical family while singing about proper composting techniques.\n\nThe Tinkerers\u2018 Club celebrated with Doc\u2019s suspicious coffee and Martha\u2019s cookies. Young Billy was already modifying the drones for the colony\u2019s spring festival. Old Joe and Martha were sketching something that looked suspiciously like a combination dancefloor and defense grid.\n\n\u00abYou know,\u00bb Lucy said, helping HERB alphabetize the herb garden, \u00abwe could add a module about space tomatoes to your database.\u00bb\n\nMarcus quickly hid his proud smile behind his coffee cup. His granddaughter might not design super weapons, but she understood something he\u2019d learned too late: the best defense systems were the ones that brought people together - even if those people were planning elaborate agricultural revenge.\n\n\u00abHey Grandpa,\u00bb Lucy called out, \u00abcan we modify the hay baler next? I have some ideas...\u00bb\n\nHERB helpfully began listing seventeen different uses for modified hay bales, and Marcus realized that retirement had never been so interesting.\n\nThe pirates? They spread the word: stay away from that quiet farming colony. Not because of the defenses, though those were impressive. No, it was the robot. The one that wouldn\u2019t stop talking about space carrots.\n\nSome weapons, Marcus reflected, watching his granddaughter sketch plans with their recovered robot, were most effective when they came with love, laughter, and extremely detailed lectures about proper gardening techniques.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, a little bit of glitter.\n\nPrompt:", 
    "Assistant": "Having retired from a long career of designing ever more deadly super weapons, you live on a remote, peaceful colony planet. Well, it was peaceful, until some space pirates decided it was easy prey to plunder frequently. Last time they stole your garden robot, and you want it back."
