### Guidelines:
- Output **only** a valid Python list (e.g., `["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]`)
- Use **one-word topics** (e.g., "Magic", "Destiny", "Conflict")
- **Avoid duplicating similar words** (e.g., use either "Fantasy" or "Magic", but not both)
- **Generalize where possible** (e.g., "Supernatural" instead of "Vampires")

### Examples:

**Writing Prompt:**  
"Three wishes? Okay, my first one is I wish I knew what to wish for that would have no negative or unintended consequences."

**Output:**  
`["Wishes", "Consequences", "Magic", "Philosophy"]`

**Writing Prompt:**  
"The magical ability test results got leaked... what nobody expected was some rando to be the most powerful mage at the academy."

**Output:**
